Because being able to see what the program actually does is critical when transacting on the blockchain where code is law.In this quick guide you\u2019ll learn the language basics so that you are too able to to create vyper contracts.Why VyperThe language\u2019s principals are simple:- Security: it should be designed in a way that security comes automatically when writing the smart contract without having to do extensive tests and security checks.- Language and compiler simplicity: both should strive to create simple code that is not overcomplicated with unnecessary functionality.- Auditability: the ultimate goal is to have a programming language that is simple to read by any person regardless of their experience with computers in order to give them understanding while keeping security a priority by making difficult to write bad code.That\u2019s why Vyper is limited in functions compared to Solidity where you have less restrictions in place, to help people understand the code while making it secure. Based on those 3 principals, Vyper has a unique set of features for smart contract programming:- Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level. Many of the issues with traditional smart contracts written in solidity is the fact that mathematical calculations are insecure because of the EVM\u2019s natural restrictions. You can\u2019t store an endlessly large number on a uint variable because it would be abused, and miners would have to process excessive computations every time. Vyper aims to solve that by checking overflow and underflow issues when compiling.- Support for signed integers and decimal fixed-point numbers: in this programming language you can have positive and negative integers with decimals unlike Solidity where decimals are not allowed because of number rounding limitations.- Decidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call. In other words, every function should provide a clear indication of how much gas it consumes at any point.- Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared). Many new types are added to Vyper to provide better readability.- Small and understandable compiler code: the compiler code is optimized as much as possible in every contract.- Limited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state which forces developers to guarantee that the code is behaving as expected.However, to fully implement the desired goals, Vyper is limited in functionality and thus it doesn\u2019t have the following programming capabilities:- Modifiers: they are not available because they may code tedious to understand since you have to jump back and forth to the modifier definition and because developers could write misleading code with unexpected functionality.- Class inheritance: when a smart contract inherits from many others, you have to jump back and forth between them to fully understand what is going on. Also, it\u2019s another point where programmers could write misleading code that executes unexpected functionality.- Inline assembly: assembly code is not searchable since functions and variables change their names to simpler values that are harder to understand and modify.- Function overloading: it\u2019s a problematic feature where the same function with different parameters could damage users with dangerous code.- Operator overloading: another problematic feature where developers could for instance, change the + operator to a potentially dangerous function.- Recursive calling: it makes function gas costs hard to predict and it\u2019s one of the many reasons you can\u2019t fully know how much gas you need to execute every function in solidity. By removing this feature, we also remove the possibility of gas limit attacks such as the reentrancy attack.- Endless loops: such as while and for loops without restrictions. They make impossible to calculate gas limits and could be used as an attack vector.- Binary fixed point: decimal fixed point is better, because any decimal fixed point value written as a literal in code has an exact representation, whereas with binary fixed point approximations are often required (e.g. (0.2)10 = (0.001100110011\u2026)2, which needs to be truncated), leading to unintuitive results, e.g. in Python 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1 != 1.File structureIn Vyper you don\u2019t have to specify the version of the compiler since the best one is automatically chosen for your smart contract. You can start writing code immediately in a .vy file or using an online compiler such as vyper.online which I recommend to help you with debugging and compiling quickly as you develop.VariablesVyper has a wider variety of types of variables because they want to improve readability as much as possible. Therefore, what\u2019s better than a descriptive type of variable?In Vyper you start with the variable name, then a colon and the variable type with the visibility. Variable\u2019s visibility is the same as in solidity and you specify them like so:myVariableName: public(uint256)As you can see, you start with the variable\u2019s name and then you declare the type without a semicolon at the end since this is a python-based language.Variables in Vyper can either be private or public. Public means that anybody can access that variable including external contracts and private means that the variable can only be modified internally in this contract. To make a variable public, use the keyword public before the type and to make it private, just use the type without the public keyword.myVariableName: public(uint256) # A public variablemySecondVariable: uint256 # A private variableRemember that each smart contract needs to be setup in a single file so it\u2019s independent. These are state variables that get declared at the top of the contract. Note that you can\u2019t give a value to the variable when defining the type of the state variables.Following are the types of variables available in vyper:- uints: unsigned-integers which just like in solidity, can only be positive numbers. In vyper you only have the 256-bit version so all your unsigned-integers must be declared as uint256 including the number at the end instead of just uint. For example:myNumber: uint256- ints: signed-integers. These integers can be either positive or negative and as such, can only hold up to 128 bits of data so all your ints will be int128. Additionally, you can use the min(x, y) and max(x, y) functions with integers for making quick calculations. For example:myNumber: int128- booleans: they can either be true or false. You specify them with the bool keyword. For example:isValid: boolWhen dealing with if statements and conditions using Booleans you have several operators that you need to know such as:x not y: Logical negation. Instead of using the ! symbol in front of the boolean, you use the not keyword.x and y: Logical conjunction instead of using the usual && symbol.x or y: Logical disjunction instead of the usual || symbol.- decimals: this new type of variable stores a number with a precision of 10 decimal places between -2**127 and (2**127\u20131). Remember that in order to compare numerical variables, they must be of the same type i.e. both numbers have to be decimals. For example:myDecimalNumber: decimal- addresses: just like in solidity, a variable that contains an Ethereum address in hexadecimal notation with a leading 0x marker. For example:myAddress: addressNote that you can retrieve the balance contained in an address with the balance member variable:myAddress.balance- bytes: bytes store pieces of text in hexadecimal format. You can either use bytes32 or a custom bytes size. The larger it is, the longer text you\u2019ll be able to store inside with some clear limitations based on the gas limits. Basically they are strings with limited length. Fixed-size byte arrays can hold strings with equal or fewer characters than the maximum length of the byte array. For instance:username: public(bytes32)myArticle: bytes[1000]The variable myArticle will be able to store a string of up to 1000 characters while the username will be able to store a 32-character text. Custom-size byte arrays have several interesting functions that you\u2019ll often use when dealing with large strings:len(x): returns the length of the string.sha3(): returns the keccak256 hash as bytes32 of the string.concat(x, . . .) concatenates multiple byte texts into one.slice(x, start=y, len=z): to cut a string into a shorter piece. Starts at y with the length z.Those are the main variable types available in vyper. After that, you have personalized unit types based on decimals, uints and ints. These are new types that you can freely create to improve the readability of your code by using custom words. Vyper has 3 unit types built in:- timestamp and timedelta: both measure time in seconds so 1 unit of this type is 1 second. Timestamp represents a point of time i.e. a specific date while timedelta contains the number of seconds. For instance:whenThisWasDone: timestampexpirationTime: timedeltaThey measure time and are based on the uint256 type.- wei_value: a measure of ether in the smallest unit, the wei which is one 18th part of 1 ether. Again, based on the uint256 type so it has the same limitations regarding positive-only numbers. For instance:amountSpent: wei_valueAlternatively, you can create your own custom unit types for improving your code\u2019s readability. Here\u2019s how it would look like:units: {   centimeter: \u201ccentimeter\u201d,   km: \u201ckilometer\u201d}Define them at the top of the file. You\u2019ll then be able to use them with a conversion parameter being either uint256, int128 or decimal. For instance:myCustomMeasure: uint256(centimeter)distanceFromMars: decimal(km)Those variables will store the same numerical values as simple uints or decimals, but they now have a specific unit type that give them a deeper meaning that improves readability to the external programmer.ArraysArrays in Vyper are pretty much the same thing as in Solidity. They are called lists since that\u2019s the official python terminology but in my opinion, it\u2019s just easier to call them arrays. You can create multidimensional arrays and simple arrays with square brackets however they all must be fixed with a limited size set beforehand. For instance:# An array of uintsmyNumbers: public(uint256[10])# A multidimensional array of addressesmyAddresses: address[10][20]# An array of 30 texts of 1000 characters eachmyArticles: public(bytes[1000][30])To add elements to your fixed-size arrays, you\u2019ll often have a counter of the latest modified index so that you can update it:myNumbers[3] = 25# With a counter variable it would look like thismyNumbers[latestNumberIndex] = 25# Set multiple valuesmyNumbers = [1, 4, 7, 3, 2, 9, 1, 3, 0, 9]# Get the value of a specific indexreturn myNumbers[4]Remember that arrays have 4 useful functions to get the length, calculate the hash, concatenate arrays and to slice them as previously seen in the bytes type definition.StructsStructs are pretty straightforward. You define them like in solidity but with python\u2019s syntax so it will look like this:# Create a structstruct Tree:   age: timestamp   name: bytes32# Create the struct instance variable (inside a function only)myTrees: Tree[10]# Initialize the struct (inside a function only)myTrees[0] = Tree({12, \u201cMy own tree\u201d})# Accessing a value (inside a function only)myTrees[0].timestamp = 19182They are great for creating objects that store complex types of data.MappingsMappings work the same way as in solidity. They just store endless amounts of variables in hash tables that can be retrieved with the index type. You can only declare them as state variables and modify them inside functions. Here\u2019s the syntax:myMapping: map(int128, bool)# To access a value (can only be done inside functions)myMapping[28] = TrueThat\u2019s all about Vyper\u2019s variables. You now know how to use them and how to define them. Let\u2019s take a look at functions and to fully understand a smart contract\u2019s structure.EventsEvents in vyper are pretty straightforward:# Event definitionMyEvent: event({from: indexed(address), amount: uint256})# Calling the event inside a functionlog.MyEvent(msg.sender, 10)As you can see, the event is similar to how you create it on solidity. You can use the keyword indexed to make that parameter searchable inside the blockchain\u2019s past events. Then, you can execute it with the function log.<yourEvent>().Note that they must be defined at the top of the file before the state variables and functions.FunctionsFunctions in vyper are similar to those on solidity but with python syntax. You still have to specify the visibility, the return values and the parameters. Here\u2019s how a function in vyper looks like:@publicdef sumTwoNumbers(numberA: uint256, numberB: uint256) -> uint256:   return numberA + numberThe return value is indicated with the arrow syntax -> instead of using the returns() keyword compared to solidity and the visibility is indicated using decorators which are just special keywords on top of the function.Functions in vyper can either be public or private. Public means that anybody can access and execute the function while private means that it can only be executed by the contract itself, just like internal functions in solidity.You can also add the @payable decorator to be able to receive funds with the function call. For instance:FundsReceived: event({amount: wei_value})@public@payabledef receiveFunds():   log.FundsReceived(msg.value)When a function is payable, you can access the ether received with msg.value.To read of modify state variables inside functions, you must use the self keyword. Here\u2019s how it looks like:myNumber: uint256@publicdef exampleFunction():   self.myNumber = 3If you don\u2019t, the compiler will think that you want to access the local variable with that name which makes the use of underscores before the variable naming unnecessary for function parameters compared to solidity where you must use underscores to update state variables easily.The constructorThe constructor is just like in python. Use the __init__ function to setup initial variables or execute internal mechanisms when the contract is deployed. For instance:@publicdef __init__():   # Do something here when the contract is deployedObviously, the constructor can\u2019t return any value, so it makes no sense to provide a return value to it.The fallback functionThis function is the one being executed when you send a transaction to the contract without specifying the function that you want to call, basically when making ether transfers to the contract. Here\u2019s how it looks like in vyper:@public@payabledef __default__():   # Do something when receiving a transferDocumenting your functions with NatSpecThe NatSpec documentation is a simple way to explain what your functions are supposed to do. It\u2019s important that you use to facility the understanding of your code for future developers and to improve it in the longer term. Here\u2019s how it looks like:@publicdef addNumbers(numberA: int128, numberB: int128) -> int128:   \"\"\"   @author Merunas Grincalaitis   @notice Adds 2 given integers and returns the result   @dev Works with either positive and negative numbers   @param numberA The first number to add   @param numberB The second number to add   @return int128 The number resulting after the addition   \"\"\"   return numberA + numberBAs you can see, you have several parameters to describe your functions. @notice is the one used to explain what the function is supposed to do for external readers. Be as concise and clear as possible. @param and @author describe the parameters of the function and the function\u2019s creator.And @dev is for giving additional information for coders to help understand some internal logic that may be irrelevant to the end users.SummaryThat\u2019s about it!

All Vyper syntax is valid Python 3 syntax, although it has not adopted the entirety of Python 3\u2019s feature set. Vyper is in its early stages of development, but the open source project is available for us to dive into and contribute to right now.This article will outline the real principles and reasons behind Vyper, the differences to Solidity, and various syntax we should be aware of. Finally we will visit the installation process of Vpyer.I personally like the project \u2014 looking at their example smart contracts is very seducing; they look and feel like Python; the contracts present themselves in a very familiar way Python developers have come to appreciate, and this simplicity is beneficial for reasons we will discuss further down the article.If you would like to familiarise yourself with Solidity as well as Vyper, visit my Solidity on-boarding article aimed at developers to start writing smart contracts with the language:Writing Smart Contracts with Solidity > 0.5A brief walkthrough to start writing Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity 0.5 and abovemedium.comVyper First Glance & PreconceptionsAt a first glance we notice some very nice Pythonic ways that Vyper smart contracts are created with. Decorators are used to inject extra functionality into each method, scrapping Solidity\u2019s modifiers in the process. We use the familiar __init__ as the contract\u2019s constructor method, which is executed once when the contract is first deployed. Defining contract parameters is clean. With Python being a statically typed language, we define the signatures of each parameter we will be working with at the top of the contract, in a name: scope(type) like fashion, for example:highestBid: public(wei_value)As you can see here with wei_value, Vyper have introduced some Ethereum specific data types \u2014 this is only one of a range of types we can exploit in Vyper smart contracts.Vyper aims to minimise bugs, maximise auditabilityThe wei_value type demonstrates well what Vyper is all about.wei_value is the smallest denomination of Ether. Where decimal numbers are concerned, Vyper have opted to work with real fixed point values, rather than binary fixed point approximations.This demonstrates one of the core principles of Vyper \u2014 minimising room for error.With the belief that we as developers read code more than write it, we want to understand quickly and make contributions without guessing or error. Seeing an actual value rather than an approximation or truncated representation of the value aids in that process; what I am seeing are tangible values.Is Vyper more secure than Solidity?What you may have heard on video blogs or articles online are claims that Vyper is a more secure language than Solidity.Is this true? Not entirely. Although the probability of bugs is reduced, it is still the developers responsibility to ensure secure code.Now, what Vyper does include are some bug contingencies for us \u2014 we can utilise upper bounds for gas consumption, and can utilise bound and overflow checking. These are neat features to minimise bugs, but regardless of the language you adopt, it is still the developer\u2019s responsibility to write readable, maintainable code.The language we use is only a tool, the values of which we can either embrace or ignore. We could utilise Solidity\u2019s more verbose nature to create a great contract; we could also utilise Vyper\u2019s simplified nature to create an equally great contract.Concretely, Solidity and Vyper are both higher level languages that compile into bytecode, which in turn is deployed on the blockchain. A Solidity contract and Vyper contract hosting the same logic will have almost identical bytecode when compiled.So where does the added security lie if not in language contingencies? In the coding practices of the developers. In their development process, testing process, auditing process and documentation \u2014 both inline and through readme\u2019s and change-logs. Seasoned Python developers will be fully aware that well-written code acts as a means of documentation itself; let the code tell the story so comments are not needed \u2014 and when they are, have a detailed docstring with function usage examples.Without digressing too much into code practices, let\u2019s visit some other things you may have heard about Vyper.Vyper in experimentation, not commercially readyWhen I hear this being said, I reply with this: Name me a blockchain that is commercially ready and not in experimentation.Yes, Vyper is experimental and there will be changes. But do not let this stop you from experimenting with Vyper yourself; the facts are as follows:We can install, compile and deploy smart contracts with Vyper today.While Vyper is still in early development, so is every blockchain, including Bitcoin. Examine the disagreements within the Bitcoin community to realise that we are still far from where we need to be for it (and other blockchains) to become mainstream solutions for the world.Vyper and the Ethereum ecosystem is open source. It is constantly in development, proposals are being submitted and fine-tuned before being deployed, on a constant basis. There will be commercial use cases early on (ICO, ownership of virtual goods) that are realised way before others are technically possible (payment systems that compete with the speed and scale of centralised solutions). But they are coming.Vyper is here today; let\u2019s begin using it.There is one other big Vyper myth I will address.Vyper solves the learning curve issue of Solidity = falseIt is important to realise that Vyper is not a fix for the Solidity learning curve theory. It is an alternative to Solidity, not a replacement.The claims that developers will not embrace Solidity because it is yet another language to learn, with another learning curve which will take weeks to learn are simply false. Other blockchain groups have used this theory as a marketing tactic to create a perception of a weakness within Ethereum. But ultimately, Solidity is not hard to learn.Solidity adheres to object oriented design patterns developers will be familiar with from every other object oriented language out there. A developer could, without issue, read through the Solidity documentation and study the smart contract examples in a matter of hours, before adopting the basic ERC-20 contract or similar contracts.What Vyper does is offer an alternative smart contract language that aims to solve completely different issues to the issue of learning difficulty.Now, let\u2019s move onto what Vyper offers us on a more feature based level.What Vyper OffersVyper offers us a full smart contract development solution. The Vyper compiler is written in Python, whereas the Solidity compiler is C++ based. Although C++ is dramatically faster than Python, speed is traded with consistency in the Vyper pipeline.Like Solidity, there is an online IDE for Vyper, at https://vyper.online. Vyper can also be integrated into a Truffle development workflow, allowing you to test Vyper contracts on local private blockchains very easily.Apart from the syntax and core principles we have talked about, there are other big differences to Solidity. They are listed on Vyper\u2019s Github home page, but for completeness here are the main differences:No modifiers. Modifiers can add complexity and make code less readable \u2014 this goes against Vypers goal of making code as readable as possible. We don\u2019t want to worry about understanding the rules of precedence within our contracts when conflicts occur, nor do we want to jump around numerous contract files to find where those conflicts occur.No inline assembly. The idea of compiled code inside of Vyper code is a big no no. Variables will be represented differently making it impossible to CMD+F all instances of them. The switching of syntax also makes the code less readable.No function overloading. The last thing we want to do is worry about which version of a function is being called, creating confusion when errors occur and time wasted troubleshooting inconsistencies.No operator overloading. Vyper argue using such syntax as += looks misleading. Operator overloading is also not Pythonic.No class inheritance. Again, jumping through multiple files to understand what the code is doing is anti-Vyper.No recursive calling and no infinite loops. These are dangerous when we need to spend gas for every contract operation, greatly increasing the probability of gas attacks.No binary fixed points. As discussed above, Vyper opts to display values as an exact representation.It almost feels as though Vyper thought Solidity was a way too verbose language given the lack of experience the world has had with smart contract development. After all, once a contract is on the blockchain we cannot change it. If a bug is discovered our only option is to replace the entire contract, which comes with major migration difficulties and expenses associated with doing so.So what Vyper is saying is, let\u2019s take a step back and focus on what we have learnt so far \u2014 maybe readability, auditability, simplicity (and therefore security) are far more important than issues like language robustness at this moment in time.Now the community have the option to make that call.Vyper SyntaxHere we will outline some interesting ways we can code smart contracts with the pythonic Vyper.The best way to familiarise yourself with Vyper syntax is visiting the Vyper by Example documentation page, where a range of example contracts are included for us with comprehensive breakdowns. The examples range from an auction / bidding use case, product purchasing, crowdfunding, voting and company share management.Contract variables and selfWe can access contract variables from any function with self. For Vyper contracts, it is recommended we define all contract variables at the top of the contract.Examining the auction contract on the Vyper examples page, we are defining the beneficiary, auctionStart and auctionEnd contract variables by providing the _beneficiary and _bidding_time arguments for the __init__ method:beneficiary: public(address)auctionStart: public(timestamp)auctionEnd: public(timestamp)@publicdef __init__(_beneficiary: address, _bidding_time: timedelta):    self.beneficiary = _beneficiary    self.auctionStart = block.timestamp    self.auctionEnd = self.auctionStart + _bidding_timeAlso use self to call other methods within the contract, with self.<method_name>()Data typesVyper provide a dedicated page for the types it supports. Along with common types such as booleans, signed ints, unsigned ints, decimals, strings and byte arrays, we also have access to some other Vyper smart contract specific types:timestamp and timedelta: These are both unix based (uint256) time values. timedelta represents a period of time, and can be added to a timestamp value. We can also add 2 timedelta together, but cannot add 2 timestamp together \u2014 this is logically incorrect, as a timestamp represents a certain point in time. For time manipulations timedelta is the type to use, such as the bidding time period on the auction contract.address: The address type holds an Ethereum address. We can also gather the balance of an address with _address.balance, and the code size of the address with _address.codesize.Note: variable names prefixed with underscores are used throughout the Vyper documentation, which represent a local method variable where a contract variable may have the same name, as to not confuse ourselves between the two. They can also be used to distinguish a variable from a type declaration.wei_value: We touched on this type above, which is the amount of Ether in wei, of base type uint256.Custom types with units{}: Custom types can also be defined with a base type. For example, if we needed units in say, kph (kilometres per hour), we could define a custom type for this:#define custom typesunits = {    kph: 'kilometres per hour'}#use custom typecarSpeed: int128(kph)Structs: useful for defining custom data structures that consist of multiple variables:car: {   owner: address   value: wei_value,   maxSpeed: int128(kph)}_car.owner = msg.sendermsg and contract objectsLike Solidity, Vyper gives us access to the msg variable within every function defined in the contract. We can access its member variables sender and value to retrieve details of the address that called the contract \u2014 sender being the Ethereum address, and value being the amount of Ether the user sent with the call (or transaction \u2014 every interaction with a smart contract entails a transaction to take place).assertAssert throws an error if a certain condition is not met, and is used at the beginning of methods to check if criteria are met for the method to process. If not the transaction is reverted and the contract terminates.assert is commonly used to check if a user has a sufficient balance to carry out a transaction:assert msg.value <= self.car.valueAnother more unique example of this is within the refund method of the crowdfunding Vyper contract:def refund():   assert block.timestamp >= self.deadline and self.balance < self.goal    ...The contract is reverted if 2 things happen here:If the block timestamp \u2014 the timestamp of the current block of the Ethereum blockchain we happen to be on \u2014 is greater than the deadline of the crowdfunding campaign. Because we do not want activity carried out once the campaign has ended.And if the contract balance has not reached the goal of the campaign. Because if the campaign\u2019s goal was reached the funds should no longer be accessible for refunds.Overall, asserting is widely used as a clean way to condition methods.EventsEvents are an important part of the Ethereum EVM / web3 ecosystem whereby web applications can listen out for events that happen on the blockchain and react to them.In the example contracts, Vyper define events after our custom units{} but before contract variables. Take a look at a Transfer event that takes the following form:Transfer: event({_from: indexed(address), _to: indexed(address), _value: uint256(currency_value)})This Transfer event emits the from address, to address and value of the transfer. These key value pairs are wrapped in a JSON like format with curly braces which provide the only argument to the event() function:<NameOfEvent>: event({nKey: nValue, ...});Events are undoubtedly very useful for letting web3 based applications know the state of your contract execution.__default__ methodThe __default__ method is executed when a call to the contract is made without a function identifier, or if the supplied identifier did not match any within the contract. __default__ must be annotated with @public. It cannot have arguments and cannot return anything.AnnotationsAnnotations (or decorators) of methods allow us to define whether they are public or private, as well as other configurations such as payable and constant that are Ethereum specific. Decorators inject more functionality into methods in a clean, concise way.Most methods you define will be public and take the following form:@publicdef myMethod():   ...We can annotate methods with any number of decorators too. Consider adding the constant decorator, which means the method only reads the blockchain without modifying its state \u2014 think readonly.@public@constantdef myReadMethod():   ...@payable is another useful decorator. If the method is annotated as @payable, it is executed whenever the contract is sent Ether (without data). __default__ would most likely need to be executed in this case:@payable@publicdef __default__():    ...Built in functionsIt is important to remember that Vyper does not include all of Python 3, so familiarising yourself with the built in functions available will save on unintended errors, which can be found here.As a general rule, if you are unsure on what syntax to use \u2014 think Python. Vyper\u2019s online IDE will flag errors and warnings should mistakes be made, making experimentation a good way to get to grips with Vyper smart contracts.Installing VyperVyper is available to download, compile and install on all major operating systems. It is highly recommended to install it within a Python virtual environment. As well as compiling from source, we can also use pip to install vyper:pip install vyperAnd also have access to a Docker image:docker pull ethereum/vyperVyper have a dedicated page for installation. Without repeating too much of the content, I recommend visiting it to see details for your preferred installation method:Installing Vyper \u2014 Vyper documentationVyper can only be built using Python 3.6 and higher. If you are already running Python 3.6, skip to the next section\u2026vyper.readthedocs.ioIf an installation issue crops up on your system, be sure to let the developers know\u2014 post an issue on Github for the community to work through. If you do encounter an error, you can still experiment with https://vyper.onlnie while you await collaboration on your issue.And this wraps up this introductory talk on Vyper. Be sure to review the documentation to familiarise yourself with everything the language offers (and does not offer).I am also interested in hearing what other developers think of Vyper \u2014 let me know in the comments or on social media.Refer to the following links to work your way through the documentation and Github project:Vyper DocumentationVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u2026vyper.readthedocs.ioGithub: ethereum/vyperPythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM.

Unless someone forks over money, you can\u2019t count them as a customer.How many times have you gotten someone to \u201cpledge\u201d that they\u2019ll be a customer only to have them come up with an excuse later on why they won\u2019t be.But charging is hard especially when your beta users are people you want to keep happy \u2014 sometimes they could be your close friends. Sometimes it could be an influencer that you don\u2019t want to offend or a business relationship that you don\u2019t want to lose.Whatever the reason, it\u2019s hard to come out and say, \u201ccan you give me money?\u201d when you have an unproven product or even just an idea.It was something I struggled with for a long, long time, but I finally cracked the code with my latest startup, VYPER, which is a SaaS startup with tools for growth hackers to grow their email list. We successfully took a few pre-orders and validated the idea before the product was even ready.It\u2019s especially difficult for SaaS entrepreneurs because the outside world feels that since our service is digital it should be easy to give out free accounts (they never factor in hosting, AWS, customer service, dev costs, and the time we\u2019ve just spent helping you get on-boarded).So HOW do you actually charge your early customers without coming off as a douchebag?First off, you should make a clear distinction between 2 groups of beta users.There are some beta users who basically are just doing you a favor and aren\u2019t really getting much out of your software at all. For these guys I generally don\u2019t pay attention to them and don\u2019t actively try to collect money from them.There are beta users who are actively using the platform and seem to be getting a lot of value from it.You want to be focusing on group 2.How to go for the ask, politely.Pre-development stage: Use Celery to take pre-orders, make sure the customer has purchase intent.When you go looking for pre-orders, be very specific. After you give your pitch, say \u201cis this something you want, and what would you pay for it?\u201dIf you get a yes, then send them a Celery page which asks for their money. This app make it really easy to start accepting pre-orders, and your customer won\u2019t get charged until you have a product. Make sure you emphasize this point with your customer, especially if you still have 6\u201312 months of development left.Another point of emphasis is that you want to let them know there is a reason why you\u2019re asking for their CC. It\u2019s not to take their money and run, but you need enough commitments so that you know this is an idea worth developing, because it\u2019s going to take a lot of your time.Also let your customer know they\u2019re getting a great deal for being an early customer. I recommend giving each of these customers a lifetime account so you don\u2019t have to worry about porting that user in as a monthly subscriber when the time comes.Know that you\u2019re going to get a ton of flakes at this stage. People are gonna give you every excuse in the book to not pay you. But you NEED this pre-validation to know whether this is a software idea that you can really pursue.Noah Kagan, the CEO of SumoMe and AppSumo, says you should be able to get 3 paying customers within 48 hours to validate your idea. That might not be possible for everyone, but I\u2019d say give yourself a month to get 3 pre-orders, BEFORE you start coding up your next SaaS app. This will both give you a nice little deadline while also testing the market and seeing if this is something that people actually want. It\u2019s better to lose a month of pre-validation then 6 months coding up your solution to absolute crickets.You\u2019re likely going to get a few people that are right on the cusp of wanting to pay for your software, but they want to see it in action first. Don\u2019t worry, keep these people in your sales queue and hit them up back when you have your early working prototype.How do you even GET people to talk to for pre-orders?Go to events where your target customer might reside and talk to everyone. Don\u2019t ask for the sale right there, just get a meeting.Ask in Facebook groups & Slack chats if \u201canyone is having trouble with X\u201d then add those people as friends. Then explain your solution to them.Basically your pre-orders is all about RELATIONSHIPS. Even before you start your email list, start build relationships now!Of course having an email list obviously helps, the more people that know you, the more people that you could potentially market to.Working prototype stage (beta testing): Be upfront. Tell them you\u2019re trying to validate your idea and you need their money. At the same time, hand-hold them and provide a lot of free value through your time.Those people that were wishy washy at the pre-development stage, here\u2019s where you can wow them and get them into your app.It\u2019s important that you show your app for free first. Mention that you want to show them exactly how your software works and really guide them through it 1-on-1.Let them know transparently that you want their honest feedback about whether they would purchase your software, and if they wouldn\u2019t that\u2019s totally cool.After your user has been inside your app, you can kind of see whether they\u2019ve gotten on-boarded and have gotten value from your software. The key here is now that someone has gotten on-boarded and really like your app, they\u2019re gonna WANT to pay you.Give them a discount for being your friends/early customers. We did this for a couple of our early beta users and they all were cool with paying a substantially discounted price for access to our app.This is good when your early beta users are all people that are fairly close to you, like friends and acquaintances.Another approach: Put up a paywall after X amount of months and let your beta users know.The early version of our software didn\u2019t have any paywall. Eventually we added the paywall and made it so that users had to pay in order to access certain features of our software. When that happens you should email your beta customers and let them know that you\u2019re finally charging for the product and they can get a discount.This is more effective when you have a good number of beta users who aren\u2019t necessarily your friends. This not only activates your current free beta users to pay for your product, but it also does it in a way where your beta users feel good about getting a discount.How do you respond when they ask for your software for free?One issue that I faced when I ended up charging some close friends was they asked me, \u201chey dude, can you hook me up with a free account?\u201dBut my script that I came up with was basically this:Tell them we\u2019re in the process of business validation, and we need people to pay for the service so we know that it\u2019s something to continue with.But at the same time, you\u2019d like to give them a highly discounted lifetime account so they don\u2019t have to pay monthly fees for this.Lastly, if they really make a big deal out of it and don\u2019t want to pay for it, then just give it to them for free.For me, I chose to give some accounts for free because these were literally my best buds and I didn\u2019t think it was really worth fussing over.ConclusionThere\u2019s basically a general formula to the madness here.Give a reason why you need to take their money.Give them an offer.These 2 steps are both incredibly important because it frames the ask in the right way for your customer. Instead of thinking, \u201cOh, he\u2019s such a jerk for asking me to pay, even though I did XY and Z for them!\u201d your early user now thinks, \u201cCool, I\u2019m getting to support this entrepreneur while also getting a discount.

Multiple smart contract languages are at the bleeding edge of innovation in competition to become mainstream. In addition to the well-known \u201cSolidity\u201d, there are several experimental languages targeting Ethereum:Bamboo \u2014 A morphing smart contract language (Not actively developed)Vyper \u2014 New experimental pythonic programming language (Actively developed)LLL \u2014 Low-level Lisp-like Language (Not actively developed)Flint \u2014 New language under development with security features including asset types, state transition, and safe integers (Actively developed)Pyramid \u2014 A dialect of the Scheme programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). (Not actively developed)What is Vyper?Vyper is an experimental smart contract language. It aims for simplicity, human readability, and security. Also, Vyper\u2019s syntax resembles Python.\u201cVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201dLanguage Goals of VyperSimplicity \u2014 Vyper focuses on simplicity and maximizes the chances of writing error-free code. Its compiler implementation also strives for simplicity.Security & Audibility \u2014 Building secure contract comes naturally, that's what Vyper aims for; the code should have a natural reading flow for any reader. That's why Vyper encourages building one-page smart contracts. Code readability provides for better code audibility.Vyper Vs. SolidityVyper\u2019s goals as a language are different than those of Solidity. To achieve simplicity, readability, and audibility, Vyper doesn\u2019t include some of Solidity\u2019s features such as Modifiers and Inheritance. In addition, Vyper also doesn\u2019t include:Function overloadingOperator overloading (Solidity also doesn't support it as of 17 Jan 2018)Recursive callingInfinite-length loopsInline assemblyBinary fixed pointVyper scarifies all of the above to achieve it's design goals. However, Vyper does provide some interesting features :Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level, which improves performance and increases reliability and security.Support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call.Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared).Small and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state.Among the above, decidability is a very important feature which you can use to estimate your upper bound of gas usage. This can help in gas optimization, which is a very important part of a smart contract platform.Installing VyperLet\u2019s get to it and install Vyper now. If you are running MacOS, check instructions here (I am running Ubuntu 16.10).Note- Vyper is in active development, so don\u2019t lose patience if you get installation errors. \ud83d\ude03Install Pythonsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install python3.6sudo apt-get install python3-devCreate Virtual EnvironmentIf you have worked with Python before then you must know about Virtual Python environment. It is strongly recommended to install Vyper in a Virtual Python environment.To create a new virtual environment for Vyper run the following commands:sudo apt install virtualenvvirtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvsource ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateYou must still be in the Virtual environment\u2026 now let\u2019s install Vyper:git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.gitcd vypermakemake testIf everything went fine, then first thank to Byte God \ud83d\ude03 and compile an example contract:vyper examples/crowdfund.vyThere are many examples in the example folder of the installation directory. We\u2019ll be going deeper into Vyper usage in future articles, so remember to hit subscribe below!Truffle with VyperTruffle 5 launched recently and it includes Vyper support.

Say, you\u2019ve lost your wallet and you need money to get a bus ticket. Which technique do you think will work better with strangers?Scenario 1You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, I need money for the bus\u201d.Scenario 2You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going? Sorry to bother you, I\u2019m in a bit of a pickle and you seem like a genuinely decent person and that is why I\u2019m asking you. So this is the situation\u2026 \u201dWhich attempt do you think will work out better?It\u2019s definitely the latter.Staying ColdA lot of email marketers have in fact chosen the first route.They don\u2019t put their heart into it, they don\u2019t do their homework and they want quick results. A lot of outreach folk also do not segment their audience or truly understand their audience\u2019s pain.This is why cold email outreach has got a reputation of being a difficult channel to get business from.Without the initial hard work, the people you reach out to will remain cold.When they don\u2019t get the results, they start complaining and they spell doom for the entire Industry. They usually write a post about how Email Marketing is dead because it didn\u2019t work for them.Warming things upAnd over the years, in an attempt to be professional, a lot of cold emailers have stuck to a script and have completely avoided any informal talk. You should know how important informal talk is. One of the reasons languages were developed was because of people\u2019s need to gossip.If you stick to your robotic script, it\u2019s going to go nowhere. Here is an example of a chat conversation with a potential customer. We got talking about cities and the world and after a long conversation, a rapport was built.I\u2019m not saying, fake the rapport. Be genuine. And don\u2019t be a robot. You don\u2019t have to become Facebook buddies with every customer. But it helps to form a bond.So at Find That Email, we use a few techniques for warming up a lead during outreach. Here are some ideas that you could use.5 Ways to Go From Cold to HOT!Idea #1 : You are part of our same Facebook group.Have you ever been in a situation, where you were interacting with a stranger and they happen to mention that they are from the same city as yours and your interest in them piqued?There\u2019s something about being from the same tribe or group that warms people up immediately.It\u2019s the same thing with marketing, when you mention that you are from a particular Linkedin or Facebook group that they are part of and that is why you are reaching out to them, It immediately makes them at ease.Here is a sample idea.Hey Joe,I\u2019m John Doe from Sweet Candy Tech. I see you are part of the SAAS Hacks group. It\u2019s a great group isn\u2019t it? Considering both of us are in the same group, I\u2019ve made a tiny assumption that we we might be interested in the same things\u2026This is something we have constantly used at Find That Email with a good amount of success.Idea #2 : Common Friends with the Rock.This actually requires a common friend.It\u2019s pretty easy to make common friends. A few people on Linkedin do accept requests from strangers that they\u2019ve interacted with a total of zero times. This is not a good common friend.Here are a few techniques to make good common friends.Ask your existing friends to introduce you to people you want to knowMeet, interact, exchange ideas with people in events and meetups. Keep in touch with them on Social Media. They become your connections.There are a few high quality facebook groups which put out posts like \u201cIntroduce yourself and share your Linkedin and connect with other people on the group\u201d. Take advantage of this and reach out to people you would like in your network. That\u2019s another way of adding more contacts.So when you make connections with 10 people and they have an average of 450 people in their contacts. That\u2019s 4500 people you could possibly reach and use the common connection card.So now if you have a common friend, ask them to introduce you. Simple. Getting introductions is the best way to do partnerships and will probably the best way for a very long time.Idea #3 : The Event CardThis is a situational based warming up technique, but it works nevertheless.Say you are attending an event and you are aware of your prospect attending the event as well. You can set-up a meeting at the booth, by mailing them before the event.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I see you\u2019re going to be attending the SaasX event this August. I have a few interesting ideas to share with you about <topic>. Would you be interested in a chat?The other is, mailing them after an event is over and when you did not meet them.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I know you had attended the SaasX even this August and I wanted to come to your booth to say hi and discuss a few ideas, but I missed you by a whisker because I had an emergency. Would you be willing to chat?Idea #4 : Doing Research and Getting FeedbackA smart technique that you could use to warm up your potential lead is to ask for feedback for your research.An example would be :Find That Email is an email finding tool and say we decide to write an article about how lead generation companies can get better at getting the accurate emails and the issues companies have with lead generation companies.You can ask a potential lead their opinion on lead generation companies and how these companies can improve their service.A lot of folk will have opinions, especially if they are the right target audience and they will give you advice and tips. This is your in and you can start a conversation around the tools they use and so on.Hey Tim,This is Jody from Forest Fire Inc. You seem to be an accomplished sales representative based on your profile and I reached out to you for advice. I\u2019m writing an article on <topic>, can I have your opinion and and suggestions to improve <topic>.Idea #5 : I\u2019m a FanIn many cases, the people you are reaching out to have written content and are maybe influencers.One of the ways you can warm them up is by telling them that you\u2019ve read their content and have already shared it on your social media and to your followers.Considering you\u2019ve already done something for them, many people will treat your cold email with a bit more of warmth.I loved your article so much, I\u2019ve already shared it to my followers on Social Media and to people on my mailing list. It was AMAZING.Another way to warm up the lead is to find the Influencer that they really like. Look at their twitter, social media and find the person that they are big fans of and share a similar interest as well.Finding common ground with people is the fastest way to get people to like you.Finally I\u2019ve found a fan of <Influencer Name>, who is a bigger fan than me. I love his ideas. Which strategy that <Influencer> suggested was your favorite?Just to make things clear. These ideas aren\u2019t the only things that should be in the Email. Your email should encompassa solid introductiona reason for reaching outa strong value propositiona call to actionand your warming messageWrapping it up!You need to turn on your charm when it comes to cold emails.If you put your thinking cap on, you can come up with various ways to warm up your prospects in a cold email.Get on your experiment mode and find your technique.Also, one technique isn\u2019t guaranteed to work with everybody. You should know your audience and use the right strategy.

It\u2019s intimidating and confusing sometimes. I get that.I run userinput.io, which provides on-demand feedback on websites and business ideas, so I\u2019ve seen a LOT of questions asked. Sometimes when I look over orders that come through (out of curiosity or to spot-check the feedback), I cringe at the bad questions that I see. But the golden questions, those can really help you improve.Six crucial user feedback questions1) What do you think this site offers?This question is similar to the \u201cfive second blink test\u201d where you have someone glance at a site quickly, then tell you what it\u2019s about. If it\u2019s not clear right away, then you need to change something. Or a lot of things.By asking what the site offers, you\u2019re no longer assuming that the offer of the site is clear, and you\u2019re testing to see if a regular visitor \u201cgets it\u201d right away. And you\u2019ll be surprised of the confusion that can come out of this question.If you\u2019re on the right track with your copywriting and how you present everything, 90+% of respondents will understand what your site\u2019s about.But pay attention to everyone who doesn\u2019t understand the offer and pour over what they say.What are they misinterpreting? What was unclear? What led them to the inaccurate idea of the offer?Presenting your offer as clearly and simply (and enticingly) as possible is so important for conversion, and keeping people on your site. You of course totally understand your offer, but it\u2019s vital to step back and have other people try to explain your own offer to see where your site falls short.2) Do you trust this site? Why or why not?I don\u2019t like yes or no questions for surveys, but the second question here of \u201cwhy or why not\u201d makes it all worthwhile. Trust is such a huge factor in site activity, bounce rate, conversion, time on site, checkout, everything.This gets back to the point about the offer above. You of course trust your site. You trust yourself! You\u2019re not some scammer scumbag, you\u2019re a legit person with a legit site. Obviously!But do visitors trust your site?Maybe it\u2019s the overall design. I ran feedback on one of my own sites the other day, and one reviewer said they didn\u2019t trust my site because the design \u201clooked a bit out-dated.\u201d Trust is fickle. People are fickle. The design isn\u2019t that outdated in my opinion, of course. The site is built on a tremendously popular Wordpress plugin. But that one reviewer thought it looked out-dated, and maybe he\u2019s right, maybe it\u2019s not as elegant and modern as it could be. And that could affect him converting and being a customer.They\u2019ll pick up on other stuff, good and bad. Those who do trust your site will say \u201cI see the padlock in the address bar, I like that\u201d or \u201cYeah it looks professional and your team page has pictures and I like that a lot.\u201dOr maybe they will say \u201cNo way, it looks like a pyramid scheme\u201d but they\u2019ll explain why. And the why is the crucial part that you can learn from and execute on and come up with a plan to improve with.You\u2019re too blind to your own design, so you have to ask others, unbiased others, to tell you why your site is trustworthy. Or not.3) If you had a magic wand, how would you improve the site?This is a straight up customer discovery question, one that would be used more in the context of \u201cIf you had a magic wand, how would you make international travel easier?\u201d or whatever, in the process of trying to figure out what problem to solve with a new idea or startup.But the question is gold for site feedback too. Some people laugh at this question, because it\u2019s kinda corny. But it\u2019s gold, Jerry, gold!The great thing about the \u201cmagic wand\u201d question is that it gives reviewers free reign to dream, and say whatever they want. Their gears will turn, and it\u2019ll turn yours too. Some of the responses may not be possible (\u201cMake it free!!\u201d) but you\u2019ll get ideas for new features and different approaches.When I ran a survey on my other business, which is a screen printing company, I ran it specifically on the page for bands who want custom shirts, and there were lots of fairly common answers like \u201cmore images\u201d and \u201cmore testimonials\u201d, but two respondents gave me a couple great ideas, including that I should push our graphic design services more, which I hadn\u2019t thought to do, and combine them with the band offer more clearly.A magic wand can lead to a lot of new ideas.4) What confused you most about this site?There\u2019s a recurring theme here, but your own site can\u2019t confuse you because you built it. You\u2019re too wrapped up in it.Is the pricing confusing? Listen to your reviewers and learn how to change it.Is the offer confusing? Learn why.Do they not understand why a certain feature is there? Or why they would want it?Maybe the offer is confusing because of how it\u2019s laid out. (A reviewer for my site told me to frame the information in a table format instead, to make it easier to digest.)How long does your process take? What happens first? What are the overall steps in the process?Maybe they don\u2019t understand how to check out, or get started, or order.You totally understand your site. Your visitors may not. Find out why, and then fix it.5) What is the site missing?What\u2019s not there, that the visitors think should be there? Another variation of this question that I like is \u201cWhat did you expect to see here, that isn\u2019t here?\u201dThese questions let people tell you what they would expect to see on a site like yours. Maybe it\u2019s testimonials. Maybe it\u2019s social proof. Or images of the team. Or a clearer offer. Or probably it\u2019s something very specific to your site, so I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be, and list it as an example.Answers to this question can also lead you onto what could be included in order to help improve conversion.6) What is your least favorite thing about the site?I also sometimes run the question \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite thing about the site?\u201d because it\u2019s nice to see what people really like, but honestly, negative feedback is better than positive, so you need to find out what people don\u2019t like, and if you\u2019re lucky, you might find someone who really shreds your site, so that you get a list of a ton of things that should be improved.\u201cEverything looks great, no complaints\u201d is worthless feedback. They need to find something they don\u2019t like. And they\u2019ll let you know, whether it\u2019s your color scheme or logo or how you wrote the copy. I\u2019ve had people shred the popups on my sites before, ranting about how annoying they are. You won\u2019t know until you ask.I mentioned improving site copy above, but none of the questions relate. So what questions cover that? It\u2019s more about using the verbiage that the reviewers use, and you can also explore their fears with feedback questions, by asking things like \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest thing about X?\u201d Pour over what they really say, and then use their own words in your copy. Speak to their needs and concerns.I was running feedback on that band merch page, and one reviewer said this in an answer \u201cWe were afraid of spending a lot of money and then being stuck with a bunch of merchandise since there is often a high minimum order\u201d when asked about ordering shirts before. There\u2019s actually a lot there for me to use in the site copy, by saying that my solution of fundraising with shirts helps avoid spending a lot upfront and getting stuck with shirts that no one wants. And I also learned to emphasize our relatively low minimum order too.Four awful questions that should be avoidedWhat not to ask and how not to ask it. When you\u2019re getting feedback, you need it to be valuable, insightful and actionable. There are ways to shape questions to make them bear more fruit. And there are also ways to shape questions to make them rotten.Here are some tips to avoid bad questions.Awful: Would you buy/use this?This is an awful question for a couple of reasons, one major reason being that you never want to ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question because you want way more than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as an answer. You want detail and depth and an explanation. \u201cYes/no\u201d limits you right from the beginning, and screws up your potential for learning something that matters. \u201cYes I would buy this\u201d is nice to feel like you\u2019re on the right track, but it\u2019s still too limiting, and you also don\u2019t know WHY they would buy it. If you\u2019re going to ask a question like this, make it a two part question with \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d added on, for the real valuable info.The other reason it\u2019s a lousy question is that people taking surveys may be within your target market, and they may be within your audience, but you can\u2019t count on them to be your customers. I believe payment is validation, but this is not the time to see if they would pay.That being said, there is plenty of value to \u201cWould you use this? Why or why not?\u201d which removes the payment question, and lets you gauge the desirability of the offer, and also find out what features make it desirable and more importantly what keeps people from wanting it.A customer ran this question on an app she\u2019s working on the other day, and I reviewed her answers. It was pretty polarized, with some people hating the idea, and some people loving the idea. She ran the good version of the question with the \u201cwhy or why not\u201d part, and got tons of feedback on what people liked and what they extremely disliked on the idea.Asking \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d makes the feedback valuable. But don\u2019t just ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question.Awful: Do you like this website?Again, not valuable enough. A \u201cyes\u201d is flattering, but you don\u2019t know why they like it. A \u201cno\u201d is meaningless because you\u2019re just going to be bummed they didn\u2019t like your site and you have no idea what they disliked and how you can improve it.There are better versions of this answer:\u201cWhat do you like most about this site?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of the branding, design and appearance of this site?\u201d \u201cWhat do you dislike most about this site?\u201dAny of those questions will give you helpful feedback, way more helpful than a binary response with no clarification.Awful: How would you rate this website on a scale from 1 to 10?I am not a fan of Net Promoter Score or any system like it because it has no depth and detail and because it\u2019s not actionable at all.If someone gives your site a \u201c1\u201d, whatever. If they give it a \u201c10\u201d, whatever. Did you learn anything from those numbers? Sort of but not really. You don\u2019t know why they gave it a 1, or a 10, or anything in between. You have no actionable feedback here, so you can\u2019t take action. See the previous question and ask something that you can actually learn from.Awful: What would you pay for this?Again, these survey takes may be within your target demographic, but they\u2019re not customers or leads or in your sales funnel or anything. They\u2019re just taking a survey.Well, I take that back a little bit. If you were suave enough to get someone on your mailing list / waiting list to take a survey about your startup / idea / business, then they are in fact a potential customer. But it\u2019s really hard to talk someone from a waiting list into taking a survey, at least in my experience. You gotta bribe them somehow. Or develop personal relationships with them a bit, and ask questions one by one, not so much in a survey format.But the main reason this question sucks it that people who are getting paid a small amount of money to take a survey are not probably in a position to buy your service or product anyway. By the nature of paid surveys, those taking the survey may skew towards having less income or at least less disposable income.I quit asking this question a while ago when doing customer discovery surveys, after guys said they wouldn\u2019t pay anything, or just some really small amount for an online dating related startup I had, while customers would pay $39 or even $149 for the services.These surveys can be great to explore ideas, validate needs, and improve your website by easily learning the weak areas. They\u2019re insightful and easy, and I love them. The formation of the question is key, so spend time giving them thought.Also, make sure the questions are clear, and not at all misleading. I\u2019ve seen customers run a survey question (and I\u2019ve done it myself) where the question was not written very clearly, and it really affected the answers. You can end up getting feedback that isn\u2019t at all about what you asked, if your question is unclear.That\u2019s it. I hope this was helpful.What would you rate this article on a scale from 1 to 10?Just kidding. That question is garbage.Check out userinput.io to learn how to improve your website or idea today.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "Top Facebook Groups To Join", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/top-facebook-groups-to-join-1d40f4471c85?source=search_post---------7", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-16", "readtime": "1.91", "claps": 5, "voters": 4, "content": "Top Facebook Groups To JoinVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowOct 13, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readWell all know how important niche groups (especially Facebook) are when it comes to content marketing.Being part of a small targeted community is a great way to gain exposure for your own posts, tools, products or any other content you may be trying to promote.Having just said how cool groups and communities are there are a sh*t load of them.

It\u2019s never been easier to get an eCommerce store up and running. All someone needs is a Shopify store, Ali Express account, and the Oberlo plugin. Of course, this is the super simple version of setting up a store but you know what I mean. It\u2019s a lot easier than 10 years ago!Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billion U.S. dollars)(that\u2019s a lot of moola for the 12 million e-commerce stores active online according to lemonstand.com)It may be easier to create an eCommerce store these days but it\u2019s harder than ever to make your store stand out. Whether it be a drop shipped, handmade or custom manufactured product, the rules of marketing are all the same.It\u2019s fricken hard to win over someone\u2019s trust and convince them your product is the best and they should buy it from you.So why are some eCommerce store successful and other not?I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have see behind the scenes of dozens of eCommerce stores (successful and not), some doing over $100k in a day others at $100/day. The traits are similar for all the most successful store though.So, if you\u2019re involved with an eCommerce store and looking to scale, improve your ROI or position your store for a huge exit sale, make sure you these fundamentals tick off. There\u2019s 1 in particular that I\u2019m going to share some stats and figures on so you can replicate the same success.Most of the time a good eCommerce store will have.A niche that the owner or team understands in depth and is passionate aboutA great product (even better one that solves a time consuming or expensive problem)A website that converts 4\u20136% (depending on your average order value and product)Over 60% profit margin (Rev \u2014 COGS = Profit)A strong marketing team executing successful campaigns (people don\u2019t just \u201cfind\u201d you)Of course, there\u2019s a lot more that goes into this but these are some good places to start and if you can nail these 5 things, you will more than likely have a profitable eCommerce store.This article is going to focus on number 5 \u2014 how to execute successful marketing campaigns to grow your revenue, email list, and customer touch points (social media).There are multiple channels, tactics, and campaigns you can use likeContent MarketingEmail MarketingPaid AdvertisingViral Marketing / Growth HackingBut I know you\u2019re probably going to want the easiest and fastest results so we\u2019re going to focus on Viral Contest Marketing.WTF is that?A contest is when a brand offers a prize in exchange for the opportunity to contact all the entrants and request actions from them.Once a person enters the contest, the brand then asks them to complete actions to earn extra entries into the contest. The more entries someone has, the higher the chance of them winning is.This incentivization includes referring others, sharing the brands content and completing any other actions that are important to the brand.Here\u2019s an example contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/199Here\u2019s an example leaderboard contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/756Case Study, Stats & Results!The case study is going to focus on the company Brevite. Which is a backpack company created specifically for photographers.The PrizeMavic DroneBackpack for PhotographersRemember, the closer aligned your prize is your target markets interests, desires and wants, the more successful your contest will be.You want people to really want to win your prize so they are willing to share the contest, refer others and complete tasks that the brand sents.What the brand requested from entrantsEmail addressA follow on social mediaShare content (retweet, Facebook share, re-gram etc)Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but, boy was it a LOT for this eCommerce store!Brevite Viral Contest MetricsInvestment: $3k (prize, ads etc.)Campaign length: 15 daysSign up conversion rate: ~65%Email GrowthStarting email list: 1,700Emails gathered: 41,000Emails harvested: 36,000 (after cleaning list)Around $0.08 an email address (clean emails)Social Media Growth6,300 followers on Instagram3,079 followers on Twitter4,954 page likes on FacebookThese stats do not even take into account the follow-up sales from all of these collected emails.Not many case studies will go into this amount of depth, so we want to thank Brevite for sharing their numbers.So now you know what the contest results were but how did they do it?The next section is going into how you can get similar results.Basic Contest Promotion Strategies:Choose a really good prize that aligns with your target audience.Share the contest constantly on social channels & in groups.Add the contest to your website. (use a banner or VYPER\u2019s CTA chat feature \u2014 example)Email your list multiple times.Send email updates on the contest (examples below)Announce the launch of contestFirst week, announce top 5 entrant scoresHalfway, new prizes addedNew bonus entry addedDouble points on all bonus entries for the next 48 hours7 days to go, keep sharing & collecting entries48 hours, time is running out24 hours, last chance contest endingSubmit to giveaway directories \u2014 List HereDesign really good share images so when all the entrants in the contest share it to earn entries others are interested.Advanced Contest Promotion Strategies:If you\u2019re partnering up, get the other company to share your contest.their social mediatheir social channelsadd to their websiteCreate a YouTube video on how to do something, a product review or unboxing then link to your contest.Get influences to share the giveaway.You can purchase a shout outCall in a favor from friends, family or co-workersPitch that they have a high chance to win the contest due to their large audience.Buy ads on Reddit, Facebook, Instagram etcBonus Tip \u2014 Incentivize people who enter your contest by giving them additional contest entries for liking, sharing and commenting on your ads. This increases your ad quality score due to high engagement and will generate better results.Pay or partner up with a publication or niche authorities. Get them to share your contest with their (usually cost is a CPM, CPC or Cost per lead):Email listFacebook groupSlack groupForumAnswer Quora questions on your niche and link to your contest.E.g. Brevite could answer questions about drones and link to their contest to win one.These strategies for promoting a contest are all optional.You can choose to do all of them, one of them or even none of them, either way when you start your contest, remember you get out what you put in!So, the more work you put into promoting a contest the better the results are going to be!You can run a contest and just tell your direct audience and they will refer their friends, family, and co-workers. The contest will still get some good results but the more people you put your contest in front of, the better your results will be.So, if you\u2019re looking for a new, innovative way to collect emails, get more followers and build your business, head over to VYPER!Have a contest of your own?

Because if you just join 30 groups and just spam your contest, you\u2019re going to get banned faster than you can say, \u201cEnter my contest!\u201dHere\u2019s a detailed explanation on how to do it WITHOUT getting banned. A lot of credit to Kim of RunnerCrate, who used this tactic very successfully for her giveaway.Step 1: Find the Group and Make Sure it\u2019s ActiveThere\u2019s no point in posting in groups where the spammers have taken over. Find an active, legitimate group in your niche where people are actually helping each other. Don\u2019t go for the groups where you see a bunch of people just posting links without much discussion, as these groups have gone to sh*t.The simple way to do it is search for a keyword, for example, \u201crunners\u201d and then click on the groups tab.Step 2: Post & EngageBefore you just post your giveaway, make sure you post & engage heavily with the members. This step needs to be done a week or so before your giveaway, so you can build some good karma in the community. Be super helpful and eager and show that you\u2019re going to be a valued member of the community.This goes a long way to impressing the admins. Don\u2019t post any of your links at ALL during your first week or two, because admins can see that a mile away.Step 3: Find the Admin, Befriend ThemAgain, here\u2019s a gif showing you how to find the admins of the group. Again this is from Kim\u2019s RunnerCrate blog.Take some time to get to know the admins. Most of the time, these guys are sharing a lot of content in their own groups. Try and engage with them if you can. Make it known that you\u2019re a real person, not just some bot trying to spam Facebook groups.Aaron Janx, a podcaster, uses groups extremely effectively. To befriend admins he does a public thank you to them. Here\u2019s an example of how he thanks the admin of the Screw the 9\u20135 Facebook group, Jill Stanton.Notice how in the post he never linked to his own content, but linked to the content of the group owners. Admins love this because it\u2019s a testimonial to their work. You bet that Aaron now has free reign inside that Facebook group to subtly promote his own stuff. He also wrote a very long note in the Facebook group instead of a simple thank you. This kind of \u201csucking up\u201d is key to making the admins love you.Step 4: Ask the Admins to Share for You, with an IncentiveIt\u2019s 10x more powerful if the admin themselves shares your contest or giveaway.If you REALLY want them to share it for you, I recommend giving them some kind of free gift as a bribe. Kim from RunnerCrate offered up free boxes in exchange for having them post her contest. It can work without the bribe if you ask nicely, but for the larger Facebook groups, this tactic could be a game changer for you.And there you have it. That\u2019s how you work the Facebook groups and get your contest shared without being spammy.Ready to create your contest and start sharing it in Facebook groups?Get a free account at VYPER!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How to Promote on Reddit without Getting (Shadow) Banned or Deleted", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-promote-on-reddit-without-getting-shadow-banned-or-deleted-4a6c2e7fb1a9?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-06-10", "last_modified_date": "2017-06-23", "readtime": "5.82", "claps": 20, "voters": 1, "content": "How to Promote on Reddit without Getting (Shadow) Banned or DeletedVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJun 10, 2016 \u00b7 6 min readReddit is a magical place. It\u2019s a place where you can get a lot of traffic for nothing except your time. Reddit gets 150 MILLION pageviews per month, so needless to say you can get TONS of free traffic.At the same time, Reddit is one of those places where self-promotion is very frowned upon. Any kind of marketing is frowned upon unless you put a VERY detailed and delicate touch to your posts. If you learn how to do that, you can promote your stuff without getting your posts deleted and without getting banned.I\u2019ve gotten my stuff deleted many times in the past. I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve gotten messages like the one below.If you\u2019re new to Reddit, you need to first familiarize yourself with the platform. This is probably one of the harder parts of promoting with this channel because it\u2019s like its own society with its own rules and markup language and lingo. This article by Mashable gives a great overview, so please take a read and learn the ins and outs of the platform before you try to utilize it.And note that Reddit is a LONG TERM channel. It\u2019s not something you can just do quickly. So don\u2019t expect to master Reddit marketing overnight just like you can\u2019t master Facebook ads overnight. Any channel that is worth it will be a channel that requires hard work, dedication, and a lot of trial and error.But once you\u2019ve become an adopted member of its society, you can really leverage it for tons of traffic. Here\u2019s a quick step-by-step rundown of how to make it work.1. Spend a whole month just posting on subreddits related to your niche, get 50+ karma.There\u2019s a subreddit for every topic. A lot of times there are multiple subreddits. Find the ones related to your brand and start getting as active as possible. Look for subreddits with over 50,000 members, as these will get you the most bang for your buck. If your niche doesn\u2019t have any of these subreddits, then just look for the ones that are as active as possible.You need to get some karma so Reddit knows you\u2019re not just on there to plug your thing and leave. Karma happens when you contribute meaningfully to discussions on the platform and it\u2019s a very organic thing. So don\u2019t just go on there and post one-word answers. You need to provide as much value as possible. What I like to do is to go into subreddits where I know a lot about the topic (like /r/entrepreneur) and just answer all the questions with deep meaningful answers.I\u2019ve read a lot of posts on the web that karma doesn\u2019t matter. Actually it does. The more karma you have the more legitimate your account seems and it\u2019ll prevent users from posting stuff saying you just came in here to spam your link and then leave.So DO try to get some karma, however, you don\u2019t need thousands of karma to make it work. Once you\u2019ve got some karma, maybe like 30\u201350ish karma, you\u2019re ready to actually promote your stuff.Also note that during this time there should not be a HINT of marketing at all in your posts. Just contribute as much as possible to the community and really learn the ins and outs of every subreddit. Note the patterns of what gets upvoted to the top, what gets downvotes, what elicits a negative reaction, and what elicits a positive reaction.2. Befriend mods/admins with an incentive, then ask them to post for you.Go to the mod list which appears in every subreddit (usually appears in the bottom right corner of every subreddit). Direct message some of the guys on there and tell them that you\u2019ve been an active member and ask VERY NICELY if you can promote.Remember, it\u2019s all about positioning. Something like the following should do the trick.Hey ___,I\u2019ve been active on the subreddit for a while now, and it\u2019s been a blast. The community here really supports each other, which is rad.Before I just post something that\u2019s a little bit promotional, I wanted to ask you if it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a giveaway of my brand <XXX> and it\u2019s super relevant to the <XXX> subreddit. If it\u2019s okay with you, would you mind if I posted it? Wanted to get the okay from you first because I hate blatant spam myself.Anyways, it\u2019s been a blast contributing to this subreddit and I look forward to more awesome discussions.For an old e-commerce company I founded and sold, Winter Lotus, our team became friends with the moderator of /r/streetwear and even became a customer at his store in order to solidify our relationship. Best $50 ever sent. He posted our site on the sidebar and that generated tons of traffic for us.Getting mods to post FOR YOU works really well because the subreddit trusts them and their post is worth 10x of your own post. After the first email, you should ask them post your contest for you, and say that you\u2019re willing to give the mod a prize in return for this. Here\u2019s a sample message you could send:Awesome! You rock. Before I post it though, I was wondering if you were open to posting it for me in exchange for a copy of the prize yourself? The community trusts your word so much more, so I\u2019d be happy to give you a lifetime pro version of VYPER in exchange for that endorsement from you. Our contest can be found here: http://vyper.io/c/63. If you can\u2019t get mods to post for you, then you\u2019ll have to do it yourself.There\u2019s always a chance you\u2019re going to get deleted, so make sure what you\u2019re posting isn\u2019t violating subreddit rules. Some subreddits (like /r/startups) are super strict about self promotion so I try to do as little of it as possible in those groups. Instead I find groups that are more lenient with their policy.Here\u2019s an example of what you could post:This worked because for a couple months, Winter Lotus had been extremely active on the reddit subreddit and the community was very aware of them.Below is an example from BeardBrand, who promoted their contest on Reddit and got really good feedback. They used Imgur to host their contest image and then posted contest details in the description of the image and in the comment.4. Get upvotes from friends, but don\u2019t overdo it.Make sure you have a group of friends that will upvote your post right after you post it. Without an initial bump right after posting, it becomes hard for your post to make the front page. Upvoting rings are discouraged on reddit, so don\u2019t do it on a mass scale, but it\u2019s pretty common practice to get a few of your friends to upvote your post right after you\u2019ve made it.Other TipsEach subreddit responds to different things. I noticed /r/entrepreneur really likes long case studies. I noticed /r/startups doesn\u2019t like blog spam, so if I ever post there I always post the entire contents of my blog with links out to other content. Some subreddits only like images through imgur. The list goes on.If you get no traction on your posts, STUDY the top posts in your subreddit. See exactly what they\u2019re doing and try to replicate it. This is why I know that case studies work for /r/entrepreneurMake sure you\u2019re keeping track of time vs reward. This is why I advise you to focus on the bigger subreddits to really gain traction within their community and befriend the community heads. On the other hand, you can do more of a \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach to smaller subreddits because it then becomes a quantity over quality approach. Expect to get some posts deleted, but continue being as genuine as possible and you\u2019ll get a few posts to stick (especially in less strict subreddits).Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by 60%", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-use-content-upgrades-to-increase-your-content-marketing-opt-ins-by-60-a3572c662f26?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-12-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-16", "readtime": "3.83", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by 60%VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowDec 13, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readWhat You Are About To Learn:What content upgrades areWhy content upgrades are better than popupsStep by Step guide on how to create / use content upgradesBonus lists and resources on content marketingWhat the \u201cF\u201d are Content UpgradesSo you know collecting emails on your blog is important but struggling to make ends meet!

We spent months getting all antsy about it because we really REALLY wanted to get on. We didn\u2019t even know if our product was \u201cgood enough\u201d to get featured, but it was.It turned out to be a pretty straightforward process that I\u2019ll detail for you.Create a list of startups similar to yours that were successfully hunted on Product Hunt. Look for startups that got 200+ upvotes. You can search by \u201ctopics\u201d to find similar startups.Make a list of the hunters that submitted those products, with a spreadsheet, and find their email addresses. Get at least 5, if not 10.If you can\u2019t find enough hunters doing this, try adding the top hunters from this list \u2014 http://makersuccess.com/leaderboard \u2014 A lot of these hunters aren\u2019t super selective about what they hunt. If you need a connect, I can intro you to some of the top hunters as long as you email me kevin@vyper.ioCheck to make sure their other submissions get on average 150+ upvotes \u2014 this signals a good hunter.Send them a brief cold email (I\u2019d email 1 or 2 per day, instead of all of them at the same time, this way if you get a hunter you don\u2019t have to bother other people), something like this:Hey <name>,I noticed you hunt a lot for Product Hunt and you submitted <XXX startup> product. We have a similar product that allows you to create gorgeous viral contests that generate email leads.I\u2019d truly appreciate it if you could hunt my startup for me. We can be found at https://vyper.ioWould love to give you a free account in return, or help return the favor any way I can.Cheers!Kevin @ VYPER.ioSome Important TipsEven if your startup isn\u2019t really all that great or revolutionary, just having a beautiful design ups your chances to get featured and get upvotes. There\u2019s tons of products on the Product Hunt homepage that aren\u2019t the most revolutionary product in the world.If no one responds you just add more people to your list. If no one wants to submit your product, then that probably means there\u2019s something wrong with your product. It\u2019s probably pretty apparent why, so just email me kevin@vyper.io if you want feedback.Make sure you comment on each person\u2019s comment on Product Hunt.For more tips on promoting your Product Hunt submission and seeing our full Product Hunt story, click here.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Product Hunt", "Startup"]}, {"title": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using VYPER", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-foundr-magazine-2xd-their-email-acquisition-goal-using-vyper-e5eac4885fb?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-30", "readtime": "3.59", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using VYPERVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowMar 19, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readBuilding an email list is always a top priority when it comes to building an audience/business online. Whether your selling physical products (eCommerce) or digital products like digital magazines and courses, the email list is usually the lifeblood of the business!Foundr Magazine is a publication but really a digital thought leader in digital marketing and entrepreneurship. They\u2019ve interviews entrepreneurs like Richard Branson, Garry V, Seth Godin and a few other greats!You must be thinking, so why did they use VYPER? Well, they needed to grow their email list! So we worked with them on setting up a viral contest that tied in with the launch of their eCommerce course Grow & Scale.See behind the scenes of this hugely successful giveaway, stats and all! We kept it short, sweet and direct, should only take you 2 min to read ;)FREE Webinar: Watch the webinar that is making Shopify stores go VIRAL! [Here]1.Why did you decide to run a contest?We were launching a new training product and wanted to run a competition to build some excitement, anticipation, and ideally a great list of people who would be interested in the new course.Build some hype outside of our e-mail list. People can get overwhelmed with email marketing. I loved the idea that a competition allowed people to buy-in to the idea. They want to get involved and so I was hoping to get people highly engaged through a competition.Wanted to get at least another 5,000 emails onto our list that were interested in the new training.2. What expectations, KPI\u2019s and goals did you have/set for your contest?It was hard to guess. In my head, I wanted to get at least 5,000 emails, ideally 10,000.We didn\u2019t even realize that VYPER was going to increase other areas of our business like social followers/engagement and website traffic/engagment.3. What was your proudest achievement from the campaign?For us, it would have been the engagement on a blog post. It received over 500 comments and remains one of the most popular we have ever published.This help build exposure on the post, traffic to the website and social validation through mass engagement stats! Looks great when people now naturally find the blog post.4. What alternative marketing campaigns have you tried that didn\u2019t work?Tried other competition software that didn\u2019t have the same \u201ccustom\u201d elements as VYPER.In fact, overall they weren\u2019t as customizable and we just couldn\u2019t create such a strong result.5. Contest results:Emails \u2014 13,602+Social followers \u2014 Slightly hard to track because our following was relatively high across most channels (VYPER added social following tracking after our contest).Traffic increase \u2014 Not sure (should have placed the Google Analytics code in the custom code area within the dashboard, would do that next time).Customers/sales/rev \u2014 Was hard to track. We had retargeting plus some people were already on our list.Any other areas you saw growth in \u2014 507 comments on a paid Facebook ad an increase of about 1,000 subscribers on Youtube 19k Facebook views and 232 shares of our promotional video.6. What are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?They are super powerful. We need to do them more often.It\u2019s great to have different levels that people can unlock and trigger some rewards to keep them motivated.It\u2019s most useful, practical and powerful when designed around your goals. For example, as you taught me, having people engage on specific content. Like a Facebook dark post, or a blog post, or building up social media channels.They take effort, and you need to be excited yourself for your audience to care and get excited.Make the prize as insanely awesome as you can.7. What feature of VYPER did you like the most?THE CUSTOM reward/feature/action thing.Easy to use WYSIWYG editor.Ease of setting up a contestThe reward tiers (random winner, entry milestones, ranked winner)Custom code box to add tracking, custom CSS and any other tags8. What would you do next time you ran a contest?Probably same again, and make some better social media assets to promote the competition.The image used to share your contest is very important. Thousands of people are going to be sharing it across their social channels so it needs to look good!9. How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?Through our email list primarily as the seed audience and then announced on our social channels. Once we had the seed audience the contest leveraged the VYPER viral sharing system to do the rest.Have a business of your own?Foundr Magazine is a great source of information for entrepreneurs and you can find out more at Foundr.com or if you have any questions, get in touch with David, he\u2019s the man!

The other half is getting them to the eyeballs of the right people. The VYPER blog has been increasing at a rate of 77% growth month over month, and one of the main reasons is because we\u2019ve started writing more content while promoting it in the right places.Here\u2019s a checklist that I personally use during my blog planning, creation, and promotion phase.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 1: PlanningWhat topic should I write about?Some marketers tell you to check BuzzSumo to find relevant topics or search for relevant SEO terms before you start writing. I disagree. I think the best content comes from personal experience and writing from the heart, not from finding topics from these sites. What do I know about getting articles that work? My last online magazine (Amped Asia) to over 4 million monthly pageviews. Granted, it\u2019s a little bit different now that I\u2019m writing for a SaaS company rather than an entertainment magazine, but a lot of the same principles for good writing applies.So instead of writing your next piece for the search engines or to fit in with what\u2019s hot, why not think one step ahead? What are people NOT talking about and can you start a discussion around it? What are people saying and is there a way you can disagree with them or form a counter-point? (Like what I just did here). You CAN use BuzzSumo, but make sure you\u2019re using to to find inspiration, not to just copy the top-most shared content.What\u2019s the goal of this piece and how will I accomplish my goal?Why are you even writing this blog post? Every blogger and content marketer should have a goal in mind for their piece, and use that goal to guide how they write. If you can quantify your goal that would be best, but it\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t.For example my goals with the blog post you\u2019re reading.Add 100 people to our subscriber list.Exercise my writing skills with long form content.Show off VYPER\u2019s new content upgrades tool.Find content that resonates with the audiences at GrowthHackers / Inbound.And how am I going to accomplish my goal?I\u2019m going to link to a content upgrade, one of the best ways to promote a blog post.I\u2019m going to make this piece over 2,500 words long.The tool is displayed prominently within the article and linked to.Goes hand in hand with #2, but I\u2019m making this piece very long-form and detailed.Is this topic something that I can write extensively in and something I have actual knowledge of?Blogging is great, but most bloggers are just rehashing content that they read elsewhere. But the best articles on the web are ones written with authenticity and voice. For example, even when Noah Kagan writes about something I might not be super interested in (like last week his newsletter was about how he had dinner with 2 people at his house\u2026 weird I know) I still read it because I just like him as a writer. Same with Neville Medhora (copywriting), Rob Walling (SaaS), and certain other influencers.So with that in mind, you want to make sure the topic you\u2019re writing about isn\u2019t just something you researched just for the article. You want to make sure you\u2019ve had personal experience. Case studies do super well because they show numbers and evidence that a certain tactic works.Once I know my content, can I fit it into any keywords for SEO?Now once you\u2019ve got a topic in mind, you should look into fitting SEO keywords into your article rather than the other way around. Don\u2019t force it though. You want the article to still come off natural. With the latest Google updates, it\u2019s much better to write a quality piece rather than write a piece with the aim of stuffing keywords into the article. HOWEVER, if you can naturally fit keywords into your article then do it.Can I mention any tools or resources in my post?For me, I look to include as many tools or resources into any post that I write. This allows me to potentially connect with the creator of that tool or get some friendly back and forth going.But really this helps you do 2 things.Directly you can get Tweets or shares by the company you mentioned. Some of them will even be shouting your praises at the top of their lungs.You build rapport and possibly a relationship with the creator of the tool/resource. You never know when this might be useful in the future.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 2: CreationWrite a first draft. Wait a day to look it over.Write your first draft, but wait before you publish. I like to wait a day before I publish the article.Can I link to any previously written content?The more links you have to other articles in your blog bank, the more traffic you\u2019re going to eventually get. This is magnified when you re-purpose the same content for LinkedIn, Medium, etc.How can I 10x the value of this content?This is something I\u2019m doing more and more on the VYPER blog. Long-form content and huge guides are always your best bet because these rank well for SEO keywords and they get shared if they\u2019re especially epic. It\u2019s much harder to write long-form content, but if you can do it, you\u2019re going to have a huge advantage. That\u2019s why blogs like Grow and Convert have been killing it with content \u2014 the owner Benji is willing to write INSANE amounts of in-depth content backed by data.This stage is really the make or break point for your content. Average writers stop before they 10x their content.In a world where there is a lot of content getting passed around and not much content that\u2019s actually good, it takes the extra mile to have your content really stick with your audience. So when you think of it in that perspective, it\u2019s not hard to make content marketing work, you just need to be within the 1\u20132% that really goes that extra mile with your writing.Create a content upgrade for my piece of content.A content upgrade is a blog-specific lead magnet that is very closely related to the blog post. You can simply create a PDF version of your blog post and use that as a content upgrade. I like to add bonus content to my blog post and then combine my post + the bonus content into one PDF download.I use our in-house tool, VYPER Content Upgrades, to deliver the lead magnet and show a popup that asks for the email address. When you have a blog that has multiple content upgrades, this tool is very powerful to make it easier to setup multiple lead magnets on your blog. With providers like Mailchimp, you can only send a default \u201cwelcome\u201d email. That makes it hard to do content upgrades unless you\u2019re going to link to every single content upgrade inside that welcome email. Then you run into the problem of your reader getting the same welcome email multiple times when they find new content upgrades on your website. It gets messy. VYPER content upgrades handles this all for you AND incentivizes your reader to share the content upgrade in order to get bonus content.Where can I add numbers / evidence?People love proof. This is the reason why Nate Silver\u2019s blog FiveThirtyEight has been taking off despite talking about a topic (sports) that we don\u2019t always associate with hard evidence and numbers (he also talks about politics, but I mainly go on there for sports). It\u2019s such a smart blog because he backs up everything with charts and numbers, and he\u2019s really become the talk of the town in the sports blogging world. It\u2019s completely different from the coverage on places like ESPN and Bleacher Report.Re-think your headline.If your headline is something like \u201cThe Guide to Social Media Marketing\u201d \u2014 then scrap that sh*t and come up with something new. Make it exciting, make it lively, make it fresh. I like Neville Medhora\u2019s blog on copywriting for tips on this.My iteration for the headline for this blog post wasThe Ultimate Blog Promotion ChecklistThe Blog Promotion Checklist that Grew Our Traffic 77% (added numbers)The \u201c4-Phase\u201d Blog Promotion Checklist That Grows Our Traffic 77% Every Month (added a word with quotes to add intrigue)Phase 3: PromotionSend it to your newsletter, and ask them to share it with their friends.Activate your current audience to read your post and share it with their friends, thereby spreading your content virally.Did I mention anyone in the blog post? If so, contact them, tweet them, etc.Like I\u2019ve said already, cold outreach to the people in the blog post can help you get comments, get views, and get engagement. Ideally you\u2019ll want these people to share it with their networks.Re-purpose for Medium.Medium has an official plugin for this. I haven\u2019t cracked the code on Medium yet, so I\u2019ll probably follow-up this blog post with more when I figure out how to use Medium properly. This is one of the growth channels I\u2019m currently looking into.Re-purpose for LinkedIn.Great for posts that are business oriented. I don\u2019t think too much about this channel, I just get about 20\u201350 hits per article by re-posting it here. Great because it\u2019s native content so LinkedIn helps give it a boost. Great when you have thousands of connections on LinkedIn that might be reading your content.Re-purpose for RedditReddit loves self-posts, which means don\u2019t just link to your blog post from Reddit (most subs consider that to be blog spam). Instead make a \u201cself post\u201d which is basically your blog post rewritten as a Reddit post. Remember how earlier I told you to link to other posts in your blog? Well here\u2019s where that comes in handy.Tip: Use Reddit converter to easily transform a blog post into Reddit formatting.Also read our other article on promoting via Reddit.Add it to my library on Recurpost (you can also use MeetEdgar) so my post keeps getting in my share queue.Typically I share 2\u20134 pieces of content per day on my multiple Twitter followings and Facebook pages. Recurpost also posts it into my Facebook group.Post it up in various Slack chats.There\u2019s communities for many topics nowadays. Most Slack chats have a channel or two for self-promotion. Post them in here when you have a new blog post. Here\u2019s a good list of Slack groups you can join.Post in various Facebook groups (if it\u2019s allowed).This is powerful if you can swing it. Most Facebook groups disallow posting content, but if you\u2019re friends with the admins you can usually swing it. Here\u2019s a blog post where I talk more about posting within Facebook groups.Post it on Hacker News.Still trying to get this one to work. Sometimes I get 1k+ visits, sometimes 50\u2013100. Either way it\u2019s free traffic so there\u2019s no reason NOT to post it up here. And you don\u2019t have to be tech-focused for this to work. My friend Bemmu Soponen uses Hacker News to get a lot of traffic to his subscription candy service, Candy Japan. Here\u2019s a post he made that got tons of traffic and shares.Post it in relevant other communities.Depending on your niche, you might have communities where you can post your content. For startups/marketing I post to GrowthHackers.com and Inbound.org as well as Hacker News and Reddit.Share on my personal Facebook.Seems like a no-brainer, but just share it on networks you have access to, like your own personal Facebook.Email link roundups.There\u2019s a new type of newsletter out these days which contain purely links to other sites. Find link roundups in your niche and try to get your post listed in those roundups.Put it into Triberr.My co-founder worked on this tactic, but Triberr is basically a community where you can share other people\u2019s posts and they\u2019ll share yours. Traffic exchange type site, but it works within niches like entrepreneurship, startups, etc. So you\u2019ll end up getting some relevant shares.Promote it on Quuu promote.If you want to put any budget into it, Quuu promote is great if you fit within their categories.Get on Twitter and tweet your post to relevant users.I use automation tool Audiense to automatically send a tweet when someone follows me. Usually it says something like, \u201cHey I just wrote this new blog post on X, would you give me your thoughts? Thanks!\u201d (In fact you might be reading this blog post because you got my Tweet).Phase 4: Evaluate (Months Later)If this all seems like hard work, it is! In fact it\u2019s hella hard, which is why most people don\u2019t do it.Anything that\u2019s ever been worthwhile has never been easy.That\u2019s also why IF you do decide to write amazing long-form content, you will end up reaping the rewards of it.Don\u2019t get discouraged!The first few times you post are not going to get you anywhere.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading this article a few months later after you\u2019ve already published a couple posts. It\u2019s not too late to re-purpose those posts and keep the benefit going.Find the posts that have gotten the most traction.Find the posts on your site that have done the best for you as a blogger. We use Google Analytics and search by landing page.Add these posts to an autoresponder for new subscribers.We use Drip to automatically send new subscribers a sequence of posts consisting of our best quality posts.Repurpose content into SlideShares.This is something that takes a while to do, which is why it\u2019s in the bonus phase. Wait until your content has died down a bit then turn it into a powerpoint slide for SlideShare. It\u2019s slow at first, but over time you can get 100s of views. I\u2019m working on this tactic currently, and my first SlideShare has gotten 71 views. Not great, but it\u2019s better than nothing and I\u2019m pretty sure it will scale as time goes on.Combine blog posts to create a killer lead magnet & then promote your lead magnet.I combined multiple blog posts in the past and turned it into one large lead magnet.Then I promoted this heavily over all the channels I just talked about. This was a tactic I did heavily at my last startup PhotoWhoa, which was a daily deals site for photographers.It was great because I didn\u2019t have to write new content, but I still got a lot of new emails. In fact we grew our email list by around 400 emails using this tactic.Here\u2019s an example lead magnet we made by combining a bunch of articles.In ConclusionContent marketing and blogging isn\u2019t just spray and pray. By being extremely focused with your content and make sure you\u2019re moving the needle every time you type a sentence.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blogging", "Content Marketing", "Writing", "Email Marketing"]}, {"title": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30 Days!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/3-unusual-hacks-to-grow-your-email-list-to-7500-in-30-days-3d38d4574f0a?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-08-28", "last_modified_date": "2017-09-15", "readtime": "6.28", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30 Days!VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 28, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readSummary \u2014 Are you the average marketer or the guy working smarter not harder? Well Carlos from Pourfection Coffee decided to be the latter and share his story of collecting 7,500 emails using a VYPER leaderboard contest. He sent this post to us to publish as he was so excited with the results he just wanted to share it with others.A lion and a cheater make a betOne day a lion and a cheater were hanging out. They were both so fed up with hunting zebras, and both knew there had to be an easier way to eat.So they decided to make a bet to see which one could capture the most zebras.Both got to work immediately.The lion frantically searched for the finest grass the savannah had to offer. He then put signs up at all the watering holes promoting discounts on fresh green grass at the lion\u2019s den for the first 50 zebras. The result?750 ZEBRAS FOR HIM AND HIS PRIDE TO EAT!A feat that was unheard of.Meanwhile the Cheater decided to take a smarter approach. He decided that he should giveaway all the finest grass in his inventory for FREE.All you had to do to win was to be present at his cave at the time he announced the winner.But the catch was, if a zebra bought a friend, they would get an extra entry point to the grass contest, which increased the chances of them winning all the grass!The result of the cheetah\u2019s campaign?\u2026 7,500 ZEBRAS!!!10X the lion\u2019s campaign! He had so much zebra that he and his pack never went hungry again and had enough to give back to the hyenas.The lion was furious and accused him of being a cheetah! Ba Dum Tisss! (Sorry I had to)So what does this dumb story actually mean to you and your business?It means that if you\u2019re just beginning or looking to inject growth into your email list you can go about it one of two ways.Use a traditional method: Create a lead magnet, run ads to your site, get people to download said lead magnet, hope they find value and share it.Give them an offer they would be stupid to refuse and incentivize them to share it like mad men using VYPER\u2019s Leaderboard contest for example.We at XFection decided the latter and went from literally less than 100 subscribers to 0ver 7,500 engaged subscribers in 30 days! All while increasing our social media accounts by 1500%.If option 2 sounds a bit more appealing to you, good, keep reading. We are going to give you all of our secrets.WARNING: Following the contents of this article will make your competitors accuse you of being a cheetah. (Ok seriously last time)1. Twitter Growth Hack!Here\u2019s what you do:Use the social media automated features to work for you by adding hashtags in the Twitter Snippet.When people Tweet from the backend of the contest to gain points these hashtags will allow your message to trend.So whenever users on Twitter search #starbucks, or #coffee the likelihood our Twitter page and contest would be discovered increases.The post looked as follows. (I love how this girl added \u201camazing\u201d to the snippet! Made my day!)We produce and sell a nootropic (brain supplements) coffee creamer, which gives the drinker a boost of energy beyond that of normal coffee.TIP \u2014 Find out what complimentary brands are out there that have your ideal customer already and offer their products as a way to incentivize your contestants to share the word about you.2. How to leveraged thumbnail images to work for you!We already knew that people were going to be sharing our post left and right, so we were proactive to use this to our advantage to maximize the amount of attention it would gain.We did this by using an attention grabbing image. (See above Twitter post)Everything from the red coffee cup and text, to the girl sitting on top of the cup, the image stands out!And the results show for it.Just on Twitter, we gained 1,353 follows about a 1500% improvement.Talk about powerful\u2026Although this traffic is good and you can control it; it isn\u2019t YOUR traffic.This is why transferring this traffic into real emails so you own the traffic FOREVER is so important.And this brings me to my next point.TIP \u2014 Twitter and Pinterest do not limit your images to 20% text unlike Facebook so take advantage of that.3. Influencing Instagram Influencers\u2026 Influentially\u2026This is the magic bullet that took our list from 1,000 emails to 5,000 pretty much overnight.This hack probably takes the most amount of work, but trust me, it\u2019s completely WORTH IT!Here\u2019s the #1 key to influencers \ud83d\udc49 PROVIDE VALUE!It sounds simple because it is!Yet, too many people reach out to influencers expecting the world for doing nothing in return.Sometimes you can simply offer a sample of your product or some swag. In most cases people are going to want you to Venmo them or send gift cards.$10 Starbucks gift card for exposure to 15k coffee lovers? Yes please!Our steps were as follows:1. Find AccountsCoffee related pages with appropriate number of followers (ours were 5K \u2014 100k) were our bread and butter. Anything less wasn\u2019t worth our time and anything over 100K was out of budget. Side note here \u2014 engagement is critical!You don\u2019t want to waste your time and money on accounts that don\u2019t get the eyeballs. You want at least 10% of engagement to follower count.2. Direct MessageOnce you find a page with good followers and engagement you need to DM them and say something along the lines of:\u201cHey _____, \u2764\ufe0f your posts! We are a nootropic coffee creamer company and are giving away a year\u2019s supply of coffee to a couple of lucky people\u2026. What would you like us to get you to help spread the word?\u2026 Lmk\u2026\u201dAnd always, always make sure you negotiate for a deal where both sides benefit.Know the going rates for influencer marketing. This is a helpful chart to show you what you can expect to pay. https://influence.co/go/rates3. RepeatDo this 1,000 times and you\u2019ll have a few people that are willing to help share the contest. Posting on their story is good if they are verified since when their viewers swipe up they are immediately connected to your contest.But the best is when the influencer is able to post your link in their bio for a period of time.4. Wait\u2026.Increasing your reach like this (along with the Twitter hacks) the right person will come along and BLOW UP your list.The top 3 people in our contest were responsible for 60% of our list. When these people come along, they will quite literally take your list from 0 to 5,000 pretty much overnight.Just make sure that you\u2019re 100% ready for that kind of explosion.Are you a lion or a cheetah?That about sums up how we crushed our first campaign on VYPER! Their Leaderboard contest is so incredibly powerful!Seriously you\u2019ll want to jump on it before the masses do.It\u2019s so easy to use and setup that a couple of newbies like us were able to do it successfully! Not to mention they are always available on their live chat on their site. Any question we had was answered in a timely manner. We will be back for round two very soon!Go get more zebras!!Best of luck!Written by: Carlos Courtney | Co-Creator of PourfectionPourfection increases focus and cognition so that you can get more work done in less time.By adding nootropics, we were to reduce the crash and jitters of coffee so you won\u2019t have to crash at 2pm and drink 4 cups a day just to get by.It feels like the amount of coffee never ends, and still your eye lids feel heavy as you continue to do the same thing over and over and over.

Google\u2019s algorithm can tell when a reader is having a good or bad experience on your site, and if you write like a keyword stuffing bot, Google will penalize you (most likely because readers will bounce quickly).Sometimes \u201cweirder\u201d sounding phrases are searched more. For example, \u201centrepreneurial conference\u201d was searched more than \u201cconference for startups\u201d according to Ahrefs.Do your keyword research (using tools like ahrefs, google keyword planner, longtail pro) before you decide to optimize for a phrase that you \u201cthought\u201d was going to be more popular.Text optimization is more important than image optimization for ranking.12 Principles Of Viral Content by Nadya KhojaInfographics, especially ones that cite popular culture, tend to go viralEspecially if you show data in a more interesting format. She gave an example of a design website using Star Wars analogies inside an infographic to teach design principles.Mashups with popular culture references or relevance to subcultures have a built-in audience that will share them for you.Q+A With Patrick Collison, Co-Founder of Stripe by Patrick CollisonHow to find a good business idea \u2014 Take a complicated thing and make it easier (Stripe made payments a lot easier for developers)Focus on 1 type of user first then scale (e.g. Stripe targeted developers completely, since they were already creating things but it was painful to start accepting payments)The Case Against Growth by Dave KissThis was a very interesting talk, which gave us a different perspective on what growth is and how sometimes it can be bad. For example, if you\u2019re scaling your customer base too high, but you\u2019re alienating your customers because you don\u2019t have enough support reps.The Path to Parallel Entrepreneurship by Ryan BuckleyMaking more than 1 product is not bad \u2014 if investors can invest in multiple companies you can create multiple businesses.This diversifies your risk.Do things that you are passionate about, you never know what will happen.

The excitement, engagement and viral lift were just not present for these types of businesses.So we looked back on all our B2B marketing efforts and made a list of strategies for growing email lists. We highlighted a few of them and the issues we ran into.These were a few strategies we tried.Content marketing / blogging (too slow)Guest blogging and podcasts (way too time intense)Webinars (too much time investment and setup cost, people wanted fast results)Direct response lead gen ads on Adwords, Facebook, Twitter etc. (too expensive)Cold emailing (super boring and time-consuming)We tried all of the above methods at some point in our B2B digital marketing journey but never really found the sweet spot in quality, cost and quantity.So we thought, F**K it, lets build our own badass contest that works better than any other acquisition strategy, does what we want and makes the customer as happy as the brand/business owner. EASY, YEAH!Here is the link to the viral leaderboard contest we created \u2014 visit contest (btw it is closed so you can\u2019t enter but you can see the landing page and how it worked and generated over 7k emails for us).Download: Our key takeaways and learnings from running this viral leaderboard contest!The birth of the Leaderboard ContestWe took everything we knew about viral + contests + acquisition and growth and put it all into 1 viral leaderboard contest tool!

Not bad ;)Results from our test leaderboard contest:Emails Collected 7,000+Instagram Followers gained 850+Facebook Group Growth 350+ (we started at ground 0 pretty much)New Twitter Followers 3,000+New Pinterest followers 2,500+New YouTube Subscribers 550 (we were not expecting this!)To be honest we were a little disappointed as we had set a goal of acquiring 10k emails from this contest, this was factoring in 20\u201330% of those emails being spam or unusable.Once the contest ended, we ran the exported list though www.edq.com and discovered that only 12% of the emails were rubbish. SUCCESS! Not as bad as we had thought.We have seen some B2C niches collect a ton more emails but had 20\u201330% of them be spam so we were pretty happy with this.Not only did the leaderboard contest limit spam but it had a super high email engagement rate when we sent out contest updates like \u201chalf way\u201d and \u201cending soon\u201d notifications!Reflecting on the above we learned that our leaderboard was able to collect quality emails due to the engagement, cheater detection and nature of the contest prizes! Consider this when choosing a service to use for your contests (quality over quantity if possible)!A few things we learned from our test contest80/20 rules applies, we collected 80 of our emails in the last week.Engagement and competitiveness is awesome. By adding the entrant\u2019s avatar, number of points and leaderboard rank we were able to get people visiting their thankyou/share/dashboard page multiple times throughout the contest.Offer something epic but not too epic. We had a lot of people question if our contest was real due to the size of the prize. It is super important to make your prizes relevant to the crowd you want to attract.Support, support, support. Make sure you take the time to answer questions from entrants and the better the relationship the more they will share your contest.Our Facebook group was the most active it had ever been during the contest. Use these group settings to create a community and build relationships!By using a number of prize redemption options we were able to involve everyone who entered our contest. We offered prizes for top 5 leaderboard rankings, number of points collected (prize received after collecting 150 entry points) and random winner draw (anyone could win, even last place has a chance!).We wish we had launched the contest with the random winner reward. We only introduced it half way through the contest and I think we lost a lot of early entrants who did not want to compete for top spot!How We Did ItThe easiest way to explain this is to break it down into steps. This was for our SaaS company so is probably a little more complicated/harder that your usual eCommerce or content website.IdeationPrize/Reward (partners)Building the contestPromotionFollow-upYou can jump to any section that you may be at but I suggest you read through all the steps to make the most of your contest marketing campaign. Learn from our mistakes, it will save you a ton of time and money ;)Step ONE \u2014 IdeationThis is pretty much what we discussed above, most companies go through a stage of considering/arguing what the best marketing tactic for them is. This can be in any of the forms listed at the start of this post, I \u2018m sure there are also more options!We obviously went with viral contests as our marketing strategy to grow our email list and social accounts.Next, we had to think:Who do we want to attract?What do those people like?Where do they hangout?We identified our target marketing and then came up with a number of prizes to get people interested in entering our contest. Our magic offer was lifetime subscriptions to other complimentary SaaS products, what business owner doesn\u2019t love FREE lifetime subscriptions?We then broke down the prizes into:Rank 1st, 2nd and top 5 (highest value, hard to achieve)Number of entry points collected (lowest value, easy to achieve)Random Draw (medium value, requires luck to achieve)Once we had the reward tiers planned out we focused on finding products to offer for these tiers.Step TWO \u2014 Prize/Reward (partners)There are a few options when it comes to what to offer. The main prize is usually the product of the company or something complimentary that they purchase as an investment to the contest.E.g. A gym might offer a membership or a year\u2019s worth of protein powder. Or an online shoe retailer might offer 1 pair of shoes or a running magazine subscription.We decided to go the other way and find the top companies our target market wanted to use. For example, we wanted to get the interest of people who used Clickfunnels, MeetEdgar, MixMax, PipeDrive and a few other SaaS subscriptions.People will have a ton of articles and BS published on automating the outreach but if you just spend the time building the relationship and genuinely offering value, you don\u2019t need the automation for what we were doing.Take the time in selection and crafting your emails and your close rate will be 100x higher than any automation you can do.Out of all the people we contacted to partner with for this contest about 80% of them said yes.Here is the email we used to propose the leaderboard contest partnership.Once you have a relationship with the people you want to partner with it becomes a lot easier to promote and get feedback on your contest. Plus the benefit to this was also the follow-up partnerships in the form of joint deals, case studies and cross promotions.Of course we used a few tools in this process to remind us to follow up and keep organized. We aren\u2019t super hero\u2019s!Tools \u2014 MixMax, Google Sheets, Rapportive Chrome extensionStep THREE \u2014 Building giveawayNow that we had a number of partners to help buff up our prize pool, our contest was looking pretty good. We had enough partners on board to fill out all our reward tiers and make them pretty impressive.The next step was the setup of the actual contest. Since we used our own tool VYPER the actual build out of the contest was super quick.A few things to note when creating your contest:Always create separate sharing images for each social channel, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest all need their own sizing.Set an appropriate time frame and make sure you include some solid T&C\u2019s. Between 2\u20136 weeks are good contest lengths. Evergreen contests are also amazing but we will go into that another day!Make the prizes super obvious so people know what they can win and remind people how to win. E.g. On the contest page include a subtitle like \u201cFill in your name, email and start sharing to collect points to win!\u201d.Use images and video when possible. Most people hate reading or do not have time to do it. Use images, dot points, video and anything else you can to make the message faster and easier to understand! (I know, you are probably thinking what a hypocrite. He is making me read a 2,000+ word case study but telling me not use a lot of text!)Add your GA, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and any other code or tracking tags to your contest. You want that data! It is just as important as the email address!Here is a quick video tutorial on how to build a leaderboard contest:As I mentioned before, this part of your contest is actually one of the easiest. Just make sure to cross off the basics.We also designed and built VYPER with conversion optimized in mind so the templates have been built to get you the best conversion rates!Step FOUR \u2014 PromotionThis is a make or break step! Promoting your contest is just as important as creating it. A good prize and traffic source is key for generating tons of emails and new followers.FREE Download: 17 ways to promote your contest to make it go viral!Let\u2019s break it down by days so you can see exactly what we did:Day 1\u20133Promoted the shit out of it to personal networks (friends, colleges & family) first.Publish a blog post announcing the launch of the contest.Post to all of your own social channels every 2\u20133 days. Tag your partners if possible to spread some love.Posted in Facebook groups (ask the admins first, here is a post on that).Post in other communities like Slack, inbound.org, growthhacker.com etc.Post within niche specific forums (Warrior Forum, Sitepoint and Blackhat World are a few for B2B).Submit your contest to appropriate giveaway sites, popular one is the sub-reddit /giveaways.Run ads to get the ball rolling, remember that the leaderboard is viral so it has a snowball effect so you need to start strong. A few common networks are Facebook (easiest), LinkedIn (most expensive), Reddit (hardest), Twitter (most effective for B2B).Day 3\u20135Work with you partners, get them to share the contest on social and to their newsletter/email list if possible. We tried to get all partners to do this so there would be a benefit for everyone, the cross exposure was fantastic and all partners were exposed to new potential customers.Try and get featured on other people\u2019s blogs and industry leading websites (PR).Reach out to content curators that may be interested in sharing the contest with their audience.Day 5\u201310Send out reminder emails for entrants to keep sharing (we did halfway point and a few days before contest ended but you could send more).Repost to some of those communities if possible to give an update on the contest. For example, we introduced some new partner\u2019s half way through. Which allowed us to resubmit and update a lot of our original promotion channels.Stay engaged with support and updates on the contest to people who have entered. (Make sure to add your contact details (support email) somewhere on your thank you page)Follow up with partners to see if they have posted to social or send out an email to their audience.Day 10\u201320You are nearly there, keep going.Support and questions (a lot of this came through our website live chat as mentioned before).Keep posting to your own social channels.Send out an email to everyone who has entered. Announce that they have 1 more week to collect points to win the grand prize.By this stage, the viral leaderboard contest should be doing most of the work for you. You should now have enough entrants referring others to keep those new emails and social follows rolling in!Step FIVE \u2014 Follow UpThis step is one of the most important, you need to do a few things here to finish strong.Thank everyone for entering.Provide one final piece of value (we offered exclusive offers to our partner tools).Thank your partners.Send your winners their prizes and connect them to the contest partners if needed. Try and do this as soon as possible!Use all your leads by entering them into a value add email drip or send them further follow up offers.We found that our list was extremely engaged as we had some huge open and click through rates on our contest updates and follow up series around 40\u201350% as you saw above on the contest update emails.We also tied this into the launch of our viral leaderboard contest tool which everyone had seen a live demo of now. This really helped spread the awareness of our product launch!Final TakeawaysWe learnt a ton about SaaS and B2B acquisition from this test. We did see a lower volume of entrants compared to other B2C contests that we had run in the past but our final B2B list was much more engaged and of higher quality. Hard to say if this was due to the niche or if it was to do with the higher engaged leaderboard contest type \u2014 i\u2019m going with the latter ;).If you are to only remember one thing from this case study it should be:Plan out your marketing campaign and identify what your goal is, if it is email leads and brand exposure consider viral leaderboard contests as they worked a lot better for us in terms of cost and scalability compared to other strategies.Let us know if you have any questions about this campaign, here is a link to the viral leaderboard contest demo and here you can try it out on our free trial.Here is also a link to all our YouTube videos which show you how to setup contests in under 10min!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion Rate", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/6-ways-to-improve-your-website-popup-conversion-rate-efa47e3f104d?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-11-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "6.27", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion RateVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowNov 15, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readSummaryEasy, actionable steps to improve your website popup. More emails mean more traffic which means more sales!This short but detailed guide will require you to stop and think about your user for a second then really build and deliver something that will add value to them.Value, not annoyance is the key to a successful popup!Why You Need To Update Your Website PopupsA very common question that many website and business owners ask is \u201cHow to I grow my email list without spending money on advertising or annoying my visitors\u201d.The good news is, there are hundreds of ways to do this, but we are going to go over the most important one.Using website popups are one of the most common and effective ways to turn a website visitor into an email subscriber.Over the years, the results and methods of collecting emails has become harder and more advanced. Website users are becoming a lot more protective of their email address and to be honest they should be. There are more emails being sent than ever and the internet is full of spam!There are also now ad blockers, Google penalties and privacy concerns to overcome.At this point, you\u2019re probably thinking that using popups to collect emails sounds too hard, you can\u2019t beat Google!Don\u2019t Give Up, This Is Why You Still Need PopupsHaving worked with many clients to grow their business, time and time again we see that the more successful ones have good email lists.Email is the one audience you can OWN.It is by far one of the most effective ways to generate sales, traffic to your website and engagement. No matter how many people say email is dying we are yet to see another source be as consistent, personal or advanced as email.The conversion rate and profit per user is still higher than most other channels and there is no large controlling entities that are going to change the rules on you overnight.For example, YouTubers lost all their revenue overnight as Google changed the T&C\u2019s for displaying ads on videos or how Facebook or AdWords can shut down your account at any moment if you do something that is not to their liking.An email list you can take with you, you get plenty of warning if you are starting to annoy people and they are recoverable. A banned Facebook account is not.6 Ways To Improve Your Website PopupSo, let\u2019s get into the valuable stuff now that you know why building an email list is so important. You may already have a popup or form that is collecting you emails but I bet you still want more?Below is a list of small tweaks you can make to your website popups to improve their conversion rates.1. Frequency and cookie lengthMake sure that you are using a service that does not show your pop up again after the user has subscribed.Generally, you want to wait 24\u201348 hours before showing your pop up again to someone who did not opt-in. If someone has signed up, you never want to show them the same popup again as the popup has done its job.2. TimingYour popup needs to show at the right time to avoid annoying your visitors. When will this pop up be relevant to them, when is the right time to ask for their email?Immediately?After they read some content?After they view a product?When they\u2019re about to leave?You want to make sure you are adding value first then asking your visitor for something in return.Most of the time we suggest people set their popup when a user is intending to leave. This makes sure to show the popup to everyone but also only shows it once the visitor has finished doing what they came to do.Also, the exit intent popup can be a way to make visitors stay longer.E.g. If a pop up offered a discount on signup that user may sign up then go back to browsing your website to use the coupon. You have then re-engaged that browser instead of them leaving. Potentially even turned them into a customer.If you were to show that popup at the start of the browsing experience you would by saying you are already willing to discount your product before they have even looked at it.Other methods we would suggest are 80% of page scroll or around 10 seconds on site as a study by Quicksprout.com showed this to have the highest conversion rate.They also tested exit intent as a trigger and found that it increased conversions by 46%.In short, if you have the option to use \u201cexit intent\u201d as a popup trigger, USE it!3. DeviceYou need to show your popup on the correct device. Stop and go through your website on mobile and desktop as a first-time user.Go on, take a second to go and do that now.If the popup was annoying or hard to opt-into on mobile, consider removing your popup from visitors on mobile.A few common reasons to remove you popup from mobile are:website is slow to load on mobileyou have too much text on the popupyou have too many form fieldsyour popup conflicts with share button or website functionalityGoogle is going to start to penalize websites with popups on mobileThe signup process needs to take less than 10 seconds for a visitor to complete.4. User experienceImprove the experience of the popup, make it easy to signup or close. Limit the amount of required fields (name and email) and have a large close option or a \u201cno thanks\u201d option.A trick here is to have the \u201cno thanks\u201d option make them second guess not signing up. E.g. if we ran a coffee website my popup could say:Pop up pitch \u2014 6 barista approved coffee making tips for better brewing at home!CTA to signup \u2014 Send me the tipsCTA to close \u2014 No thanks, I like horrible coffee5. The OfferUsing \u201csignup for website updates\u201d is a terrible offer. Please don\u2019t use that!People may be interested in your brand and want updates but using this super boring offer is a sure way to decrease your conversion rate.People usually respond better to:IncentivizationGamificationYou need to either incentivize someone to take action or entertain them. So now you are wondering how the \u201cF\u201d do I do that with a pop up?See the gamified popup example we created below (VYPER shameless plug).Ways to incentivize someone to join your mailing listOffer knowledge (courses, ebook, case studies)Offer solutions (guides, free service or tool)Offer a way to save time (templates, lists)Offer a way to save money (coupons)Ways to gamifyThink outside the box, how can this experience be fun for the userSee the example above6. The Copy & VoiceThis aspect of your pop up is the one that varies the most from business to business. You need to ask yourself a few things about your website visitors.What are common phases they use (industry lingo)?What is the voice/tone (serious, funny, laid back)?How to include a call to action (sign up vs send me the tips)?How aggressive can you make the pitch (buy now vs learn more)?What are their pain points?What solutions are they looking for?Do they respond to saving time or money more?One of the best ways to really understand your customer is to build a persona of your ideal customer or website visitor.Do some research and find out what the best age, gender, income status etc is and then that will also help you answer the above questions.Once you understand your user it is much easier to write copy that will resonate with them.SummaryNow that you have all the knowledge to build an awesome popup. Take some time to think and really breakdown your current website popup.Some of these tips will take less than 15min to execute but return better results forever.Do you use popups on your website?

Most are too focused on the technical or they go too copy heavy to make any real impact. That is why marketers are encouraged to adopt a technique that has been used for centuries to entertain, educate, and inform. Storytelling is a powerful marketing tool that can make your landing pages stand out and get noticed.A good story is often remembered more clearly than mere facts. So, if you can weave a good tale, even the most technical of brands might find the secret to maximum conversions. Here are a few tips you can use on your landing pages that will bring your brand\u2019s story to life.Determine the Story\u2019s PurposeWhat are you trying to accomplish with your landing page? That answer should be provided before any storytelling is developed. You should have a clear ending in mind before you begin, in other words, and it all begins with a goal.Are you trying to entice a purchase or a subscription? This goal should be written down and looked at often so that the story always stays on track.What\u2019s the Problem?Prospects click on your landing page because some promise enticed them. They may have clicked an ad that promised to make their job easier. They may have clicked a Facebook post or clicked a link in an ebook that swore their lives could be simpler. Now they have landed on your landing page with hopes of finding this ease-of-life you\u2019ve assured.Just as you have written down the goal of the landing page, write down the prospect\u2019s problem. This is the issue that will be top-of-mind as the reader engages with your story. That is why every line must address that problem as well as its solution \u2014 in some fashion.Start Your Story with a Striking TitleYour titles can\u2019t just be good. They have to be like coiled vipers, lashing out and Striking readers, forcing them to pay attention. This type of title:Speaks to the prospects\u2019 problem. (Client Onboarding Just Got Easier & Less Expensive)Tells the prospect that a story is forthcoming. (How One Business Owner Expanded His Business in 4 Months!)Makes a promise. (Join This Business Owner Who Expanded His Enterprise in Less Than Six-Months!)Gives facts & figures. (How One Business Owner Increased Sales By 154% in Four Months!)Gets Personal. (Stop the Frustration of Client Onboarding. Finally, an Easier Solution that Costs Less!)Uses a combination of tactics. (Client Onboarding Success Secrets. 85% Faster Results and Ease-of-Use for Frustrated HR Reps)Use Simple LanguageNothing will take a reader out of a story faster than using a convoluted word that doesn\u2019t belong. Instead of saying, \u201cSusan passed the required standardization procedures that ensured her knowledge of the material was commensurate\u2026\u201d which could cause your reader to doze off, say, \u201cSusan passed all the required tests, and now has the knowledge she needs\u2026\u201dIn other words, avoid jargon and speak as though you were telling this story to a friend. And never use a long word when a short one will do.Who is Your Subject?A good story needs a protagonist; someone we can root for. Some examples might be:The owner of the company describing how he/she came across the secrets to the organization\u2019s success. (Tim didn\u2019t know at the time, but the algorithm he developed has helped 4,506 small businesses save more money with better personnel and fewer liability issues.)A client who has a success story to tell. (John expanded his boat rental business, opened a new location, and recently hired twenty new staff members.)Third-parties who have decided to work with the organization. (A corporate leasing agency chose to team up with a B2B SEO firm, for instance, because of the SEO\u2019s values, culture, and methods with which they do business.)Get to the PointThe average person spends 8 hours per day consuming various types of media. To get your brand noticed, your landing pages have to hook the reader instantly. There\u2019s no time to waste. \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut it and long drawn out introductions won\u2019t either.Instead, take a page from an actual master of writing, Kurt Vonnegut, that teaches you to start as close to the end of your story as possible.Did your service help a client expand his boat rental business ten-fold in the past year? Think about why that would be interesting to a prospect.If the prospect is a business owner who also wants to expand, describe all the benefits the client now experiences with the newly developed business.For instance, \u201cJohn Weaver started the year with one struggling boat rental business and too much inventory he couldn\u2019t quite move. Within four months, John cleared through his inventory, expanded his business, and opened a second location on the other side of town.\u201dIn this way, you are enticing your audience by helping them enjoy the fruits of John\u2019s labor. The reader can put him/herself in John\u2019s shoes, and will start to imagine it would be like to experience that sweet, sweet success.Keep Your Organization Out of ItPeople reading your landing pages don\u2019t care about your organization, how it got started, and who works there; at least not yet. Right now, the reader is focused on how you can solve his or her problem.When writing a story on your landing pages, put the focus all on the ideal prospects. Speak to that person and make him or her feel the emotional pain caused by this ever-present problem. Maybe it\u2019s frustration or anger, or regret for doing things the hard way for so many years. Eventually, you will mention the solution to the prospects\u2019 problem, which will represent the easier way of doing things. First, you need to create an emotional bond.Some excellent ways to personalize your stories so that they more deeply resonate with your target market is to use job titles, photographs of people engaged in similar job roles, quotes from others in the industry, and by using lots of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to drive your copy home.Give Your Clients the Storytelling Duties for a ChangeYou don\u2019t always have to be the one telling the story. Empowering stories told from the viewpoint of clients helps to build that strong emotional bond you\u2019re striving for. The best way to do this is to have the client tell his or her story in person or on a recording. Face-to-face Skype or Google Hangout interviews work well also. No matter which medium is used, record the client\u2019s story, transcribe the words, and convert the juiciest parts into powerful landing page copy that gets your prospects excited about your offerings.When using testimonials, pair them with relevant blocks of copy. For instance, if your landing page is discussing how easy your software is to use, that\u2019s an excellent place to drop a testimonial where one of your clients raves about ease-of-use.In this sense, testimonials act as exclamation points that highlight the exciting bits of your story.Be Relentless with Your EditingKurt Vonnegut gave another interesting tidbit marketers would be keen to follow. He said that every sentence of your story should do one of two things \u2014 reveal something about your character or advance the action.As a landing page marketer, your job is to ensure every line of your story either aligns with your title or pertains to the reader\u2019s problem. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s nothing but noise and should be removed at all costs.Format So the Story FlowsKeep in mind that people will be reading your landing pages on small screens. Not all of them, but enough that make it wise to format for mobile first.Formatting tips include:Short, simple sentences, and concise paragraphs with a good bit of space in between.Bolded subheaders that continue the story as the landing page progresses. Your reader should be able to get a gist of what the page contains just by reading the sub-headers alone.Use numbered and bulleted lists wherever possible to make content more digestible.Front load your sentences so that the main idea is early on, and so readers don\u2019t have to read every single word to get by.Your CTA Isn\u2019t the Story\u2019s End. It\u2019s the CliffhangerYour landing page told the story, now your CTA is a way for your prospects\u2019 to create their own stories. Make this part of your call-to-action language. For instance, \u201cDo you want to expand your business like John? Get in touch by filling out the form below and see how John did it.\u201dOr, \u201cStop banging your head against the wall and discover the solution that will save you time, money, and constant frustration. Click the button below and find out how to put this stress-free solution into action starting today!\u201d ConclusionA properly constructed landing page can do wonders for a brand\u2019s bottom line. Sadly, too few brands use storytelling, which is a powerful technique for remaining on your prospects\u2019 minds. You now have the ins and outs of storytelling for landing pages which should have a significant impact on your B2B audience.Author Bio: Ryan Gould is the Vice President of Strategy and Marketing Services at Elevation Marketing, a B2B marketing agency.

Choose \u201cpost a photo to IG\u201d or \u201cUpload an Image\u201d)Step 4 \u2014 Watch those entries roll in! Here\u2019s an example of the contest if you want to take a look.Idea 2 \u2014 Hack the Facebook Relevancy Ad ScoreFacebook\u2019s all the rage, but unfortunately, like all good things, the effectiveness is decreasing every year.Organic reach is dropping, engagement is dropping and CPA\u2019s (cost per acquisition) are increasing!What do you do when things like this happen? Innovate and find ways to \u201cgame\u201d the system, that\u2019s exactly what this marketing tactic is about.So what do you do!Step 1 \u2014 Create a contest with the bonus entry of liking, commenting and sharing a Facebook post you create. Make sure this post that you create is adding value and has a soft sales pitch in it, like an educational video with a discount and link to the purchase page in the text area (we will want to turn this into an ad later).Here\u2019s and Example contest.Make sure to ask people to do all three actions. You can ask them from 1 bonus entry or make a separate bouns entry for each engagement type.Step 2 \u2014 Run and promote the contest. Add it to your website, email your list, run some ads etc. Over the duration of this contest, you will start to collect hundreds of social engagements.Step 3 \u2014 When you have enough social engagement, a good number is 100+ likes, comments, and shares, turn that post into an ad.Step 4 \u2014 Scale this Facebook post to the audiences you want to target and benefit from the higher CTR\u2019s, engagement rates and relevancy scores. By using this method you can show social proof and build engagement for free.By having more social proof, your ad becomes \u201cscroll stopping\u201d, people are much more likely to stop and notice your post if it has hundreds of likes compared to a brand new ad with nothing.Idea 3 \u2014 Cheat YouTube EngagementYouTube is one of the most under-utilized platforms there is. A lot of people don\u2019t realize this but it\u2019s actually the 2nd biggest search engine. Yes, Google owns everything!It\u2019s a fantastic place to upload all your video content; branding videos, tutorials, how to videos, testimonials, product launches, webinar replays and more. You should be uploading and organizing all the content you can on this channel.One of the best ways to prove authority is to have videos with lots of views, thumbs up and comments. Organically this is not easy, you have to get lucky, work really hard at engaging viewers or wait a super long time before you get anything impressive.The hack for this is to incentivize these actions using your contest. Not only are you collecting leads but why not put those leads to work.Step 1 \u2014 Set up your contest, set a reward, pick a contest type (flash contest or an evergreen contest which is when you pick 1 winner a month or week). Example.Step 2 \u2014 Add your bonus entries for YouTube, you can also do this for Vimeo or other video content directories!Step 3 \u2014 Add that contest to your checkout page, email drips, social channels or website.Idea 4 \u2014 Evergreen ContestThis is one of the easiest ways to keep your social accounts growing and your existing customers, followers and leads feeling special.See an example evergreen contest that we actually use and is live \u2014 HEREThis is the example banner we also use in our emails and on social to get people to enter our evergreen contest. Make your images stand out, explain what the prize is and if you can, the value of it to them!A few reasons why you would want to use this marketing strategy.It\u2019s a great addition to your email drips for leads and customers. Keeps them excited to open your emails.It keeps your social channels growing (followers, shares etc).You have a constant stream of new leads into your funnel and they are referring others just like themselves.You can get people to constantly be sharing your content (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, any channel).You can change up the bonus actions every month depending on what your monthly goals are (One month we wanted to incentivize signups to our webinar, the next we wanted to grow our YouTube video views).This also gives you a great landing page to promote when you sponsor events, speak at events, guest appearances on podcasts, run joint promotions & email blasts as well as provide influencers with something to promote that people can actually benefit from instead of just asking for a sale.The beautiful thing is that when you send people to this evergreen contest, it looks like you\u2019re doing them a favor by offering something for free. But you are actually collecting their email as well as incentivizing them to complete a whole list of actions.Just look at all the things we made you do in our monthly contest above.Here\u2019s the email we added to an email drip to re-engage people who have created a VYPER account but not activated a paid plan. We know they are interested so maybe a free product will incentivize them to come back to our website.It also squeezes a bit of value out of them if they go and complete all the bonus actions of following us on social, sharing our content and leaving us a review.More ways to promote the evergreen contest:Add it to more email drips (leads, free trials, customers etc)Add to your website & blog/postsUse as a content upgrade on your blogShare on podcasts or at events etc.Add to your payment confirmation page or emailsAdd to your lead form or popup confirmation pageShare with affiliates & influencers as marketing materialPut it in your email signatureAdd to all your social profiles (also make a post and pin it to the top of your page/feed)Having this asset in your marketing toolkit gives you an asset that provides value and is easily shared and managed. Once you create the contest, just draw a winner and move the end date one month back on the last day of every month.Idea 5 \u2014 Get to the Top of the Podcast ChartsPodcasting is now a great awareness and authority building channel. Not only do you produce a TON of content but it\u2019s now very doable with the advancements in recording and self-publishing.You can create an educational or interview style podcasts to build an audience of listeners to then one day sell to (I know that sounds bad but that\u2019s the point of the podcast. Give value, get sales in return).I\u2019ve personally been on a few podcasts now (open guest requests hint hint) but the one thing that always comes up is how to market your podcast and get more reviews to increase your ranking in the iTunes store (the most common one, there are others like Twitch etc).A great way to do this is\u2026. You guessed it, incentivize it.This works really well for the launch of a podcast, two podcasts that I guest spoke on LaunchPeer and The Social Media Growth Show used a contest to grow their listeners/subscribers and game the podcast charts early on to appear in the top podcasts for business.The way they did this was using a launch contest.You can see the contest was giving away a prize that would attract the right people (marketers and business owners). These were the people that LaunchPeer wanted to listen to their Podcast.This contest generated 13 five star reviews (probably more by now as I wrote this while the contest was running), a bunch of social shares and YouTube subscribers within the first few days of launch getting it ranked high in the iTunes podcast charts.Below are a few of the bonus entries that this company used to get people engaged with their new podcast. The goal is to get your new podcast in as many social feeds as possible and collect as many subscribers and reviews within the first week as possible.The early signs of traction are rewarded with higher placement in the iTunes store and even the possibility of being featured at the top of your category, remember to choose a sub-category to increase your chances.For example, instead of choosing Business, choose Business -> eCommerce as your primary category.Here\u2019s also a great post on how to get to the top of the iTunes podcast charts.In summary, it all comes down to sending engaged traffic that\u2019s subscribing, reviewing and downloading your podcast. All of that is possible through your launch contest ;)Idea 6 \u2014 Incentivize App DownloadsWhat determines the success of an app? Downloads, daily and monthly active users usually. Revenue comes into play once you have these things in place (there\u2019re always exceptions but this is a general growth cycle for a mobile app.)For the revenue to happen you need the downloads, this is the first step and the direct response conversion goal to optimize to.Paying for downloads and installs can get expansive $3\u201315 CPA\u2019s are common depending on your industry, For example, an install on a free game is going to have a way cheaper CPA than a paid finance app.A little hack we have seen VYPER customers using to cut their CPA\u2019s is including the app download from iOS and Play Store in their contest.We recently added a templated bonus entry for this due to demand for app contests. Not only that but you can also use the entries to incentivize other actions to improve your app marketing efforts. Example.Leave a star ratingLeave a comment reviewShare the app launch on TwitterShare your app download page on FacebookThe list goes on as these are customizable actions you can create.What Next? It\u2019s your turn!This week, go and implement at least one of these marketing strategies. You do not have to use VYPER, you can manually recreate these same viral campaigns (it\u2019s just a little harder, we make your life easier at VYPER \ud83d\ude01)I\u2019m sure your head is filled with ideas at this point and hopefully, some of these hacks will give you some actionable tasks to better market your product, app or service.If you have any questions or hacks to add, leave them in the comments below!", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Holiday Marketing Mistakes That Could Ruin Your Q4 Sales", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/holiday-marketing-mistakes-that-could-ruin-your-q4-sales-7092f408e7b3?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-09-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-26", "readtime": "7.09", "claps": 9, "voters": 2, "content": "Holiday Marketing Mistakes That Could Ruin Your Q4 SalesVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 26, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readYou might think it\u2019s too early to start planning your winter (BFCM) holiday campaigns just yet.However, the large retail industry leaders are already busting out their Christmas collections, and customers are getting used to having several months to plan and do their holiday shopping. The time might just be right to start contemplating your own content marketing campaigns for the festive season.The cost to advertise over November and December increased by 2\u20133x so be prepared and avoid some of these common holiday marketing mistakes.Customers are likely to spend a staggering 80+ billion dollars in the US alone come the holidays, and most online stores see a spike in traffic as soon as the weather turns chilly (United States).And while there are certain industries that are certainly better suited to holiday campaigns (take the example of John Lewis), that\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t do something special this season and spread some holiday cheer.However, while getting into the festive mood can do you no actual harm, there are certain things you should avoid \u2014 so as not to find yourself standing alone under a mistletoe with no customers in sight.Here\u2019s our list of Christmas holiday marketing mistakes \u2014 dos and don\u2019ts!SourceDon\u2019t sell: giveDespite the above-listed enormous earning potential, and even though many a shopper will naturally associate the word \u201cChristmas\u201d with the word \u201cdiscount\u201d, the holiday season is not a time for hardball pitches and forced sales.It is the season of giving, after all, so your focus should shift to providing useful and shareable freebies, rather than coming up with the best way to outmaneuver your competition in terms of discount percentages.Freebies are a great lead generation tool even in the dead of summer, and they can go a lot further in terms of brand awareness and customer satisfaction during the end of the year frenzy.Come up with a lead or link generating a piece of content (either a video, an e-book, perhaps a case study or even an infographic) that you will specifically promote during the run-up to Christmas.It does not necessarily have to be Christmas themed itself (after all, evergreen content tends to provide a higher ROI than seasonal content), but packaging it up as a seasonal gift can go a long way in terms of promoting it.Don\u2019t be a Grinch: publish and leverage holiday contentEven if you are not a huge fan of the holidays, or if you are not planning to publish any Christmas-themed content, don\u2019t be the one who refuses to engage in the festivities. No one likes a Grinch, and dampening others\u2019 spirits is not the best way to win people over.The holiday season is an incredible time to take advantage of user-generated content, which will all likely be seasonally themed.Start up a bit of a competition on your social media requesting the best pictures of gingerbread cookies or Christmas decorations (or anything else that is both festive and in line with your brand and product) and share and promote the best ones.Reward a particularly inventive creation with yet another freebie (in the form of a discount or actual product) without announcing you will do so. Your followers will appreciate the thoughtfulness.Bear in mind that these types of promotions can get hectic and very competitive. Be prepared to set out clear rules and even face some backlash even if you have not done anything \u201cwrong\u201d.Don\u2019t recycle: be originalSome companies do Christmas exceptionally well. And even if your particular industry does not lend itself to over the top holiday campaigns, and you are sorely tempted to take a leaf out of someone else\u2019s book and recreate their ten-year-old campaign: don\u2019t.Customers tend to remember beloved holiday campaigns, and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they call you out for being a copycat. You can\u2019t reinvent Santa or the reindeer anyway.All you need to do is find a unique angle that represents your brand\u2019s identity and sprinkle some glitter over it.Focus on the main elements of the Christmas season: spreading joy, giving, selflessness. Or even on some other running themes, like snow, nutmeg, gingerbread or even Christmas lights.You don\u2019t have to invent a brand new content marketing campaign that will only run for a month or two. Try to figure out how you can add these elements into the campaigns you are already running to give them a unique twist.Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s business as usualWhile the holidays are undoubtedly a season of joy, they are also a season of mounting frustration. Don\u2019t expect your customers to behave as they do on any other day of the week.First of all, take into account the heightened stress levels, the shortened timespans they have to get things done, the fact that they are literally swimming in advertising every single day, and you will understand why they might be a little less patient and forgiving than usual.Do all that you can to provide a port in the storm: make your content lightweight and lighthearted, focus on the positive, and don\u2019t lose your own temper.The content you provide at this time of year can more specifically focus on the pain point solving variety. You\u2019ll notice the subtle difference it makes in your engagement rates.Also, make sure that your customer service and communication teams are ready to go: no matter how you are promoting your content, you will be chatting to all sorts of seasonally stressed individuals. And if your campaigns run well, you can expect a surge in inquiries and purchases.Don\u2019t forget to be prepared for them in every department.Don\u2019t pass up corny copywriting opportunities: leverage the spirit of the seasonAdding holiday buzzwords to your blog titles and email subject lines is not going to cut it. If you are not going to put a red cap on and get into the festive mood, don\u2019t falsely represent your content as being holiday themed.If you are going to mention the holidays in your titles, do make sure the actual content is to some extent similarly themed as well.A lot of campaigns package ordinary subjects (like the five best ways to drive more leads through guest posting) into something with a Christmas flare (like the five lessons we can learn from Santa Clause to improve our outreach campaigns).You can easily borrow motifs and themes from holiday books, movies or even carols, and apply them to your regular content producing subjects.If it feels too forced, or if you are simply not the kind of company that would produce such content, don\u2019t try to emulate a false holiday cheer. You will come off as phoney, and that will not fly well with your readers.Don\u2019t forget the Christmas cardsFailing to send out Christmas cards would be a huge mistake. All your leads and customers would surely appreciate a nice card celebrating the season.Don\u2019t turn it into a discount code or sales pitch either, which is what most companies tend to do. By all means, offer a discount code or do a seasonal sale, but don\u2019t put it in the Christmas card.Just stick to the good wishes, and return to marketing when the holidays are over. That way, you will be perceived as less of a corporation and more of a human entity.Mailchimp recently opened up the feature to start sending direct physical mail via a postcard, CRAZY I know!Don\u2019t wait until the last minuteWhichever route you choose: going all in and producing a holiday advent content calendar, with a new piece of Christmas-related content for every single day of the month, or laying low and nodding on while the festive season is over, you need to prepare on time.If you are going to do something seasonal, make sure you start early. While late summer might not seem the right time to get into a holiday mood, the end of October would be just the right time to start brainstorming ideas and toying with different concepts.If you wait until December, everyone else\u2019s campaigns will already have started, and you will be forced to play catchup.Set out a time when you will start working on the holiday content in advance, and see how your ideas evolve over time.That way, you will both be able to track what your competition is doing (or not doing) and come up with your own take on this Christmas season.Good Luck!Even if you are not the biggest fan of the holidays, joining in on all the festive fun is the surest way to reach new leads and customers, and engage with the following you already have.Be a little bit less serious, and try to forget about conversion statistics and all those other metrics you keep focusing on throughout the year.If the main goal of your Christmas campaign is to sell, and that remains your only focus, you will be losing out on a lot.There\u2019s a reason why storytelling is huge in marketing: consumers like to connect with a brand before they purchase from it, and Christmas time is the perfect time to establish and strengthen this relationship.Feature post author: Anita Sambol is a content strategist and graphic designer at Point Visible digital marketing agency.

These followers should be willing to spread the word about you, whilst gaining some form of value for themselves in the process of doing so.Here are a few of the best blockchain marketing steps to get started in growing your own community:1. Understand your product and find your brandBefore anything else, make sure you understand your own product and value proposition better than anyone else.This may seem superfluous, but it\u2019s critical for you to dive deep into your business\u2019s own fundamentals.What are your (assumed) value propositions, and have you validated these?Have you found your product/market fit?Does your product need blockchain or its own cryptocurrency?If so, are you planning to use a security token, utility token, or otherwise?Although it\u2019s difficult to understand these things early on in your company\u2019s journey, having these fundamentals in place will help you define your brand before you put lots of effort into marketing your blockchain project.This means that once you do start building your community, you\u2019ll have a head start and a competitive advantage because you won\u2019t be needing to change your product\u2019s messaging somewhere along the way.At this stage, focus on your story and narrative from the customer\u2019s point of view.Slapping the words \u2018decentralised\u2019 and \u2018blockchain\u2019 onto every part of your product messaging doesn\u2019t work like it may have used to.Focus on the solutions that your product provides to your users: how does it make aspects of their lives easier, or how does it save them money?2. Find a way to connect with your ideal community membersWho could benefit from your product the most, or who would it interest the most from an investment point of view?Take the necessary time to do research on this, and remember that the blockchain communities congregate in different and new channels all over the world and the web.Initially, you\u2019d like to check out existing communities, perhaps even for competing products, and build up some relationship with them.Blockchain enthusiasts specifically hang out on community platforms like Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and Slack.Start conversations!This phase shouldn\u2019t be about marketing your product or your brand to large audiences, it should be about having real, honest conversations with people that might be interested in what you have to offer.Find out exactly how your product or service could be beneficial to them.Humility is key throughout this process.Chances are that the people you\u2019re talking to have been in the space for longer than you have and that they\u2019re discerning and critical of \u201cjust another blockchain marketing message\u201d.FREE Guide: Start leveraging Facebook Groups for super targeted traffic! [Download Here]3. Make community buy-in worthwhileThis is really about giving back to your community: providing them with a real and tangible value which they can benefit from, without necessarily asking for anything in return.For example, provide them with useful content. There will hopefully be something about your product or service that\u2019s tied to knowledge only you possess.Share that knowledge.Educate your community with insightful content related to how your product works or how you envision the blockchain space to develop, also, what\u2019s in it for them? Make sure that you provide value when you ask someone to commit 20 minutes to read your content.Again, keep this within the confines of your expertise, at least in the beginning.There are enough people out there with general, sweeping statements about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Keep your insights specific to the things in which you\u2019re an expert, and grow from there. Credibility is key when it comes to marketing your blockchain project.Apart from providing your community with content, you could allow them to participate in contests, or you could provide them with early access to certain components of your product.Be creative, and always ask for feedback. Keep finding new ways to provide value and keep your community engaged.4. Find out what your community likesWhen following the above three steps, you\u2019ll hopefully find the right balance between taking your time to build valuable relationships and moving at a fast speed in order to quickly get your product to market.At the same time, you would hopefully have learned about the types of values and rewards that your community benefits from.If your product has a utility token, does it benefit your users to reward them early with the tokens that they\u2019ll be using on your platform?Perhaps an airdrop might be a good choice for you?Perhaps the contest you ran via your social channels showed significant traction?Whatever it is that showed the most results, make sure to hone in on it when scaling up your marketing efforts and building out your campaigns. These are the key selling points to get people to back your blockchain project.Try and avoid the shiny object syndrome. What works once will more than likely work again.5. Amplify reach through a viral contestOnce you\u2019ve established your initial community and figured out what type of value they\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll need to engage and scale this community.This is where we found VYPER to be a very useful tool in our blockchain marketing campaign.We used it to facilitate viral contests (also known as an airdrop, bounty or token offering etc), which are able to vastly amplify the reach of your audience size and engagement.In practical terms, this consists of rewarding people for taking part in certain actions, such as sharing certain posts on social media or creating custom content around your product/brand through channels such as Youtube and Medium.Case Study: Vyper to boost viralityAt Spike, we have successfully used VYPER to make certain blockchain campaigns go viral. Here\u2019s an example and a few steps on how we did it.Getting a person to promote and share your project is a pretty big ask.Essentially, what you\u2019re asking is for the person to put his reputation on the line for you.This is why, normally, it is a bad idea to ask for referrals straight in the awareness phase of your marketing campaign.On average, a B2C customer needs a minimum of 8 interactions before he/she is convinced to buy from you.It wouldn\u2019t make sense to start with such a big request after the second customer interaction right?This is why a fully mapped out pirate funnel is important to follow throughout your blockchain marketing campaign.The Pirate Funnel is a useful customer-lifecycle framework invented by Dave McClure. It is used to map out and optimize your marketing funnel.Essentially, for every product that you\u2019re trying to sell, the objective is to funnel them through a similar journey.If you\u2019re not familiar with it, the funnel looks as follows:Awareness \u2192 Acquisition \u2192 Activation \u2192 Retention \u2192 Referral \u2192 Revenue.The order is flexible and can be rearranged, depending on the nature of your product or service.The pirate funnel serves as a solid framework and is the ideal basis for creating a flowchart for your specific business.Example:Step 2: Determine the objectives and key results (OKRs)Setting objectives for the team is an effective way of later measuring the outcomes and results of your campaign.In the case of a viral campaign, your OKRs can be (for example):Objective 1: To build a large and highly engaged communityKey Result: 20,000 Telegram members in the community before start date of pre-saleKey Result: 40.000 participants in referral/bounty programKey result: 10,000 Twitter followers + 10,000 Facebook likes + 5,000 Youtube subscribersKey result: Project x appeared in at least 10 tech or crypto publications before start of crowdsaleKey result: Project x has been reviewed by or ran an AMA with at least 5 influencers before start crowdsale.The main question then becomes:Based on the above defined OKRs, how can we leverage VYPER to get to these key results?Through VYPER, you can reward your community with points for certain social actions.Based on the above set OKRs, there are at least three key results we can achieve by using VYPER.Step 3: Set up a rewards programThis is going to be one of the most important parts of your blockchain marketing campaign.We\u2019re going to reward the community for joining our Telegram group, liking our Facebook page, following us on Twitter and subscribing to your YouTube channel.You need to choose bonus actions that are relevant to your project. Some examples we used below. Each bonus action is rewarded with points (+8).But how are you going to get 20k people to join your Telegram group when you currently have an email list of just over 1k people?This is when the referral marketing feature comes into play.Step 4: Implement a referral programThe best part about VYPER is that, instead of just rewarding your community for single actions, you can also reward them for referring their friends & colleagues.You can do this using their landing page builder, embed it on your own landing page or add the widget to your site.This means that if your community likes your product and brand, and the reward structure (or perceived reward structure) of a campaign is spot on, you\u2019ll get your community promoting your blockchain project for you.A referral = when someone who enters your contest shares their referral link with friends or co-workers and they sign up.A reward = collect 100 points by referring others and completing bonus actions to get X number of tokens.How to make a project go viral?At this point, we\u2019re using artificial virality to grow our product reach. With virality, you look at the Viral Coefficient and try to optimize that.The viral coefficient is simply \u201dthe number of new users an existing user generates\u201d.The difference between organic and artificial virality is that artificial virality incentivizes the sharing through a tool (VYPER), whereas organic virality is when your product\u2019s success is based on the network effect.This means that your product has been built for users to organically share it with their peers (think Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter).More information can be found in this article about the viral coefficient.The difference between the rewards mentioned earlier on and the referral is that the social actions are limited.Users can only like your Facebook page or follow your Twitter account once, while they can invite an unlimited amount of friends to your contest.This key difference is important to understand.While people are more likely to follow you on Twitter than referring your project to their friends (remember, they risk their reputation to refer friends to your project), they are also wired to win a game or contest.When entering a leaderboard contest, for example, participants might not be planning on referring their friends straight away.They first start with following you on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, but soon find out there is no other way to go up the leaderboard than by referring their friends.After having done these multiple micro conversions (actions that lead users to your target conversion) and seeing their place on the leaderboard, they are more likely to promote your project through referrals.Next to that, by rewarding the referral action with, for example, 5x the points of normal social actions, you further stimulate virality.So at this point, you will likely have your community competing against each other for our prizes.If your campaign setup is spot on, and you have a positive and high enough viral coefficient, you will go viral in a natural way.For example, when you start with 100 participants and they all invite 12 friends per week on average, of which 4 eventually sign up (viral coefficient of 4), that will result in 25.600 participants by the end of the month.(conversion rate % is so high as we used an embed contest option which does not count the page views, only the conversion within VYPER.You can choose to run a contest on a VYPER landing page, your own or a website widget.).Here are some more tips for marketing your blockchain project:Make sure your prizes provide a high-enough incentive and resonate with your audience.We generally always opt for a leaderboard contest as opposed to a non-leaderboard structure, as this incentivizes continuous sharing by participants to obtain the first place and win the main prize.Think, what would your ideal customer/audience do anything to get? What has a high enough value for them to share your project?Create engaging content urging viewers to participate or share.Make sure that the content you create looks nice, and that it facilitates easy sharing.Design a good looking contest, share images and make sure the social pages you\u2019re trying to build look good and have some engagement and recent posts.Leverage urgency and social proofAlways toggle on the use of social proof and urgency. For example, add a time limit to your campaign to ensure that participants join sooner rather than later.Have the social proof feature enabled to show potential signups that people are entering.Think of relevant entriesWhat content do you want to get shared? What are the most relevant channels that you want to grow? This could mean more reward weighting for Youtube video productions rather than Medium articles, for example.Amplify awareness through adsPromote the contest yourself.

I worked so hard to get them there and I just don\u2019t want to annoy them or lose them\u201d.That\u2019s one of the most popular questions I\u2019ve gotten about email marketing ever since I started CopyMonk.It\u2019s a valid concern, of course.You don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship with your subscribers and burn out your list, especially since it\u2019s the lifeblood of your business.So the usual advice to avoid this is to limit the number of emails that you send and only send an email when you have some sort of sale going.However, there\u2019s a better way.It\u2019s totally possible to send out send out an email to your list every single day with a link to your product without being pushy or salesy.In fact, your subscribers will love you even more for doing so.You just need to know how to do it the right way by writing \u201cCopyMonk-Style\u201d emails. And one of the core principles of writing CopyMonk-style emails is the 90/10 rule.What Is The 90/10 Rule?The most important part of email marketing is to find a way to be a \u201cwelcomed guest\u201d in your subscribers inbox.With everyone\u2019s inbox so flooded these days, mostly with promotional offers, it\u2019s hard to stand out. Heck, many people even have 2 email addresses. One for \u201cspam\u201d and one for personal use.If you just write emails like everyone else, you\u2019ll be hated\u2026 or even worse, ignored.So what you want to do is create the expectation that all of your emails are worthwhile to open. And you do that by following the 90/10 rule.Without rambling on about it, the 90/10 rule is about the basic format of your emails as well as you email strategy.You want the majority of your emails to be 90% content and 10% promotional. You also want 90% of all the emails you send to follow this 90/10 rule, with the other 10% being purely promotional.Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to literally be 90/10. It can be 80/20 or even 95/5. The point is, you\u2019re delivering content while just mentioning your product when it\u2019s relevant in every email.The Catch? \u201cHow-To\u201d Content Will Kill Your Results!I had to write this section because it\u2019s the biggest mistake people make once they finally \u201cget\u201d the whole 90/10 rule thing.You see, while the 90 in the 90/10 rule does mean 90% content\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all 100% educational, how-to content.If you\u2019re only sending an email a week or less, then that\u2019s fine. In that situation, you\u2019ll probably be best suited to hit them hard with actionable value.But if you\u2019re going to write emails at a higher frequency, like you should be if you want to maximize your results, you\u2019re not going to get away with traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content.Why?Because traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content is actually boring. Sure, your list will love it for the first 2 weeks, but then they\u2019ll start ignoring it.It\u2019s like that boring teacher back in highschool.He\u2019s super smart and will teach you a ton of stuff, but within 15 minutes of class starting, you\u2019re already in the perfect position to take a power nap.However, an exciting teacher will be the complete opposite. Yea, you\u2019ll learn all of the same stuff in the same time span. But this time, you\u2019re awake, attentive, and probably even enjoying yourself a bit.You see, content itself is not valuable.Only the experience of consuming and using that content is valuable.So instead of writing just boring \u201chow-to\u201d content all the time, what you want to do is to start writing \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content.That\u2019s when you combine both educational content with entertainment so that it\u2019s easier and more enjoyable to consume.Kind of like when people put cheese on their broccoli. It just makes the experience a lot better than if it was just the broccoli.The Easy Way To Write Highly Valuable, \u201cInfotainment-Style\u201d Email ContentThousands of years ago, before writing was invented, we used to share information in a particular way.This particular form of communication was used to pass down all sorts of important information including things like morals, religion, culture, and more.It was ideal since it was so easy to remember things this way and was naturally captivating to anyone who listened to it. In fact, you can say we\u2019ve been hard-wired to both consume and share information this way.Best of all, it works with everyone.So what is this mysterious way to share information?Stories.See what I did there?The best way to write \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content for your list is by educating people by telling them a story that contains the valuable content within it. Not only that, but stories also make the content seem more valuable than it would normally seem like, but that\u2019s a story for another day.For today, I want to direct you to particular type of story\u2026 personal stories.While there are a ton of ways to write stories, the easiest and fastest way to get started is by writing about personal stories that relate to the content you\u2019re really trying to get across.For example, lets say I\u2019m selling sports supplements.I could just write emails about the 5 reasons why whey protein is so important for muscle recovery and muscle building. However, that\u2019s a bit boring.Instead, it would be a lot better to talk about the last time I was struggling to build muscle and a bodybuilder at the gym told me that the reason I wasn\u2019t getting results was because I wasn\u2019t consuming enough protein.Then from there, I could go on about how I asked this guy why it mattered and how I confirmed advice after scowering the web to see if he was right.THEN I would talk about the 5 reasons the guy talked about.As you can see, writing emails this way is a lot more interesting as you\u2019re not relying on boring content. If fact, everything that you teach with a personal story will automatically become interesting.How To Effectively Sell Your Product In The Last 10% Of Your EmailSo here we are, the most important part of your email.Fortunately, if you did everything else right, this is also the easiest part of your email.That\u2019s because you\u2019re not hard-selling anything. Instead, you\u2019re going to use the same tactic David Ogilvy, probably the most popular advertiser ever, used to sell billions of dollars worth of products.You see, David Ogilvy is considered the father of \u201csoft-selling\u201d.What\u2019s that? Well, that\u2019s basically when you sell something without pushing it. Almost always, it\u2019s just a mention of your relevant product or service.The most famous example of this was with the house ads David Ogilvy wrote to promote his ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather. They were wildly successful leading, so they led to lots of copycat ads.If you notice the very bottom right of his ad, he talks about Ogilvy & Mather, but doesn\u2019t pressure you into becoming a client.In fact, in his case, he doesn\u2019t sell you on it at all. He says the only ones who gain access to all his other great content are his clients.So if you liked his ad, then you would naturally want to become a client to find out more.Now, in the case of your email, we\u2019re not going to be so \u201csoft\u201d about it either. You\u2019re still selling your product. The difference is that you want to tell people why they should buy your product in just a couple of sentences.Anymore then that is too hard and anything less then that is not hard enough. You want to be in that \u201cgoldilocks\u201d area during this part of your email.Do this every email and your list will never mind it. In fact, they\u2019ll probably love you for it since you\u2019re making it easy for them to buy something if they\u2019re interested.An Example Of The 90/10 Rule In Action From CopyMonk DailySince this whole 90/10 rule is probably new to you, it would be best to actually see a real example of this.So I\u2019m going to show you 1 example from CopyMonk daily, which is my daily email marketing newsletter for business owners.Notice how I use story to ultimately teach something and then pivot into a sale without ever being pushy or salesy.Check this out:In this email, I\u2019m talking about what happened in a particular episode of Nathan For You. You can read the email for all the details, but realize how you don\u2019t see me teach anything until I\u2019ve given it context by talking about the show.Then, I end the email with a call to action to my product.In this case, I\u2019m connecting my educational content with something I teach inside my course, This builds curiosity and leads to an easy and non-spammy transition from content to promotion.Like I said, this is my daily newsletter. So I write emails like this to my list every single day. Yet, even though I sell in every email, people love getting my emails.ConclusionMost business owners suck at email marketing.Fortunately, if you follow the advice in this article, you\u2019ll be a lot better off. Not only will you sell more products, but you\u2019ll also build a deep relationship with your list at the same time.Now that\u2019s what you call a win-win.With that said, If you want a 100% free, 1-page checklist that summarizes my entire CopyMonk methodology to writing emails, then click here.Danavir is the founder of CopyMonk, where he helps business owners double their sales with email marketing.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Copywriting", "Email Marketing", "Copymonk", "Danavir Sarri"]}, {"title": "Case Study: The Extremely Viral eCommerce Giveaway", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-the-extremely-viral-ecommerce-giveaway-5fe510d4cfe5?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-02", "readtime": "4.61", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Case Study: The Extremely Viral eCommerce GiveawayVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJul 2, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWhats better than running a successful marketing campaign that crushes all your goals and expectations?Someone running that successful marketing campaign for you!This case study was provided by GroMo who ran a VYPER giveaway to clear out one of their e-commerce clients old product stock.At first, that was the goal anyway.

A large part of this was crafting an email that explained to influencers that they could leverage their audience to easily climb the giveaway leaderboard and even win the grand prize. This removed the need to provide payment for posting as the trip to Hawaii was enough incentive.Email marketing funnel: automated and one-off emails to keep contestants engaged.Gamifying the contest using an audience segmentation funnel.Promoting the contest using Gromo\u2019s proprietary paid media strategy.What Didn\u2019t workUsing cold prospecting Facebook Ads, you need to segmented targeting with audiences, interests and engagement type.Working with micro influencers on Instagram that don\u2019t have swipe-up capability.

They climb the leaderboard by getting points, namely through referring others to the contest or by following you on social media. So for example, your contestant might get 25 points for following you on Instagram.If that\u2019s a bit confusing, try signing up for our demo leaderboard here.What are the benefits of a viral leaderboard?Generate cheap leads \u2014 The cost to get someone\u2019s attention and acquire an email address is constantly increasing. Depending on the industry, you can be paying between $3\u20135 an email. Using contests rewards users for giving you that information as well as incentivizes them to refer others. We\u2019ve seen leads come very cheaply with viral contests.Build a larger social following \u2014 You don\u2019t wanna be paying for fake followers. The viral leaderboard makes it easy to generate a larger social following by incentivizing the follow in exchange for extra \u201cpoints\u201d in the contest. In fact, we used a viral leaderboard contest to add 550 new YouTube subscribers, one of the hardest networks to build followers on.Increase sales volume \u2014 Contests are not just for acquiring email addresses. You can also use them to drive more sales on time of entry using unique coupon offers as well as nurture those leads into customers. On average it takes 2\u20134 brand interactions before a purchase is considered.Increase brand awareness \u2014 Nothing works better than word of mouth. Using contests is a great way to get a large amount of exposure for your brand. As entrants share your contest with friends and family they \u201cendorsing\u201d you brand and essentially recommend you to their friends and family to check out.Build audiences for advertising (Facebook custom audiences & lookalikes) \u2014 Facebook is now one of the best marketing channels the web has to offer. If can be expensive and hard to get started though. Facebook will then go and find the people who are most alike to that list for you to then serve ads to.One of the first things you MUST think about when you create your leaderboard, is what prize structure you want to offer. An optimized prize structure can make or break your contest.How to use a tiered rewards system to maximize your resultsIt is a good idea to offer multiple ways for entrants to be rewarded. This keeps people engaged and helps keep them motivated to continue sharing your contest. There are 3 main reward types that are most common.Placement rewards \u2014 This is when a contest rewards the entrants that performed the best. For example \u201c1st place wins a $500 Swiss watch or Top 5 entrants win a $100 watch stand.\u201d This is the CRUX of your leaderboard. Get people competing to get the top rewards.Points rewards \u2014 This is when a contest rewards entrants for reaching a certain number of points. For example \u201cunlock a 20% OFF entire store voucher when you reach 200 points.\u201d This one is important because even if the new user is super far away from the top of the leaderboard, they\u2019re still incentivized to get points.Random draw rewards \u2014 This is a more generic reward type and this is just a winner chosen at random. Adding a random draw just gives even more incentive to your entrant to share the contest and get more points.So now you can see there are a few different ways to get people involved in your contest. The most important part is to make your contestants feel good, give them points, reward them and congratulate them.Setting Up Multiple RewardsFrontend Rewards DisplayLittle do they know you are warming them up for your ultimate monetization strategy.BONUS Checklist \u2014 6 Common Success Factors From Over 10 Viral Contests! DOWNLOADHow do you monetize your contest, effectively?Offer unique coupon codes \u2014 Make your contest entrants feel special, give them a special coupon code/voucher only they have access to. Use the wording \u201cget a promo card\u201d or something similar. Then send an email with an image of a fancy card with the coupon code on it instead. This increases the perceived value of the coupon. (Make them feel like they won something special).** We recommend giving them a smaller reward as a \u201cpoint reward\u201d \u2014 like $10 \u2014 when they reach 100 points. We found $10 \u201cpromo cards\u201d work really really well VS a $10 off discount. Just think about it \u2014 when was the last time you threw away a gift card and when was the last time you threw away a \u201c$10 off coupon?\u201d You NEVER throw away gift cards! However, you forget about or throw away discount codes all the time.Remind your contestants to share to get more points \u2014 Send them a sequence of follow-up emails to get them to keep sharing the contest in order to get more points. Hit them also through social media. The more people you collect the bigger the follow-up email paycheck will be.Make a super high discount for people that reach a really high number of points \u2014 For example say a user gets 100 points per referral. Give them an 80% discount if they get to 10,000 entries. Getting emails of 100 people will probably worth that amount of money. Remember at the end you will be doing a follow-up email trying to convert all these people.Contest follow up email \u2014 At the end of the contest you can send out an email thanking everyone for entering, and that the winners have been drawn. Also put together a special deal for entrants only like a custom coupon code or a \u201cbuy 1 get 1 free\u201d deal. We wrote a blog post just on this topic here.Educational email sequence \u2014 You may be selling a higher ticket item, so ease your way into the sale by sending 2\u20133 value-add educational emails first. You could start off with a few emails on why they need your product. Highlight that they entered the original contest for a reason, they already wanted your product. It might just take a few more convincing emails to convert them.Company update emails \u2014 Now that you have the contest entrants\u2019 emails, send them an update when you have news about your latest products.Gift/purchase idea emails \u2014 If you contest was not a good fit for a direct sales, suggest that they purchase for their parents / friends!Holiday deals emails \u2014 If your product is seasonal, now you have a huge list to alert every time New Years, Christmas, Mother\u2019s Day, etc comes around! Start off your high season strong with a warmed up audience that already knows about you and your product.Birthday offer emails \u2014 Since you can collect more data for a contestant to enter why not ask their DOB, so when their birthday comes up you send them a special offer. They can either claim it as a gift to themselves or share it with someone who will buy it for them ;)For a more in-depth article on maximizing your email revenue, click here.tl:dr \u2014 Tips on how to monetize your viral contests:Use unique coupons for that contest onlyFollow-up emails asking your contestants to share, being specific HELPSChoose relevant prizes to your target audience (You want to attract the right crowd)Add consolation prizes (so everyone wins)Increase the perceived value as much as possible (what does not cost you a lot of money but is very valuable to others).

People love a free book (and knowledge!) so a book giveaway contest was a great way to engage people.This also ensures them a steady flow of intellectual content to their email inboxes, and getting that intellectual content is basically why they signed up to enter the contest in the first place.We found Vyper via Product Hunt and the giveaway setup was super easy!The promotion strategy we used for your giveawayThe only promotion we did was announcing the book giveaway through all of our social media channels as well as our already-existing email list.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.We really didn\u2019t have to do much promotion or our giveaway at all!The before and after results (use as many images as possible, people love them and can share them) traffic leads sales inquiries etcWe ran the giveaway for a limited time using the VYPER countdown timer and saw a 125% increase in our email entire email list size from a single giveaway.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How to Create a Landing Page in Under 163 seconds", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-create-a-landing-page-in-under-163-seconds-1276bf64f451?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-23", "readtime": "4.03", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "How to Create a Landing Page in Under 163 secondsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 17, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readSummary \u2014 Building landing pages can be a HUGE hassle, especially if you are not interested in paying over $100/m for advanced landing page builders or expensive developers.We saw this as an issue for a lot of website owners that wanting to improve their marketing efforts but were limited on resources. That is why we updated our tools to solve this problem in under 163 seconds!See how to turn any Interactive Popup or Content Upgrade into a landing page that converts like crazy.What you will learnHow to turn your Content Upgrade into a landing page.How to turn an Interactive Popup into a landing page.Why you need to be using landing pagesThey keep the browser focused on your main goal (signing up as a lead).They allow you to deliver easy to read and understand value propositions.They make it much easier to exchange an email for a digital asset (guide, checklist, discount codes/vouchers, training videos etc).They have a much higher conversion rate than regular website pages (means more leads and sales).They keep your messaging consistent and decrease confusion.They are much faster to create than new website pages (Usually).It is acceptable to use overpowering CTA buttons.Ideas on where/when you can use landing pagesInstagram (or other social channels/directories) bio linkFor social ads (Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Twitter, Reddit, Quora etc)In guest posts (this will allow you to capture leads from some else\u2019s website)In social media posts. Turn your organic posts into lead generation forms.In email cross promotions (partner with a complementary brand send emails to each others lists, but capture their readers with your link injected pop ups)Turning your content upgrade into a landing page.Step 1Create your content upgrade like you usually would in the VYPER dashboard. Add an image, the downloadable asset, text, and styling.You have a few reward options to choose from when using VYPER. You can redirect people to a thank-you page or deliver an asset (lead bait) directly to their inbox.A redirect would work if you wanted to give someone access to training videos but an email delivered to their inbox would work better for a PDF checklist or guide.Step 2Go to the last step when editing you Content Upgrade in the VYPER dashboard and get the Content Upgrade ID.Step 3Add your content upgrade ID to the below templated URL. (Replace the 273 with your own content upgrade ID).Template URL for Content Upgrade landing pages \u2014 https://vyper.io/cu/273You have 3 options on how the landing page URL will display.Use the VYPER url (same as the example above)Sign up to the enterprise version and use a subdomain (e.g. https://sub.domain.com/cu/273)Use a link shorter like Bitly or Sniply.Step 4Start using your new landing page.E.g.

Writer Ian Chandler emailed me after I wrote the original Reddit strategies article, and he said he could had some counters to my ideas. I invited him to get on our blog post to share his strategies.So let\u2019s hear it for Ian Chandler!Using Reddit as a marketing tactic is tricky. Few sites are as unrelenting as Reddit is. Make one wrong move, and you\u2019ll be ridiculed, or even worse, banned.But Reddit can be a potent source for brand attention. If you can get on the good side of the hivemind (more on that in a moment), it\u2019s like winning the lottery. You\u2019ll get a bunch of free publicity and tons of customers out of it.The other day, I read VYPER\u2019s post on Reddit promotion. As a narrative marketer who uses Reddit for networking, traffic, and other professional means, I thoroughly enjoyed it and reached out to Kevin with my own perspective. He asked me to share it with you, and I couldn\u2019t deny.I\u2019ve been using Reddit consistently to get brand fans, and I have to reiterate what Kevin said in his post \u2014 Reddit is a long term channel. Slow and steady wins the race here. But once you\u2019ve provided value and built trust, Reddit marketing becomes extremely effective.Promoting on Reddit the right way is tricky, so it\u2019s important to not screw up. Here are my 5 best tips for marketing on Reddit.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide. FREE!1) Create immense value.Redditors don\u2019t want to see rehashed info. They want long, in-depth guides that offer an authoritative take on a subject. Tell your readers why you\u2019re qualified to post on the subject, and then hit them with a few thousand words of detail. Of course, this depends on the niche you\u2019re in, but in many niches, a 3k-4k word guide performs amazingly.It\u2019s even better if you create a post just for Reddit instead of reposting an article from your blog. Redditors love this because that means the content was created with them in mind. In other words, they\u2019re not being subjected to blog spam. If you repost an article, make sure to post the full text and only include a link at the bottom of the article. You\u2019ll appeal to Reddit\u2019s better nature, and your chances of getting traffic are much higher.And don\u2019t create any fluff, either. The average Redditor has an unparalleled bullshit detector. They\u2019ll know if you\u2019re spinning or summarizing. Instead, just provide straight-up value. Write it not to get upvoted, but to help people. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll succeed.In fact, I wholeheartedly believe that value should be at the core of your entire marketing strategy. If you\u2019re not giving away too much value, you\u2019re not standing out from your competition. Be the brand in your niche that is synonymous with value, no matter what you\u2019re doing.(Editor\u2019s note \u2014 If you want to repost your entire blog post onto Reddit, use Reddit converter to make it easy!)2) Spend more time answering questions and giving advice than posting.Posting without commenting on other threads is one of the best ways to piss off Redditors. If you\u2019re doing nothing but plugging your site, people will get tired of you almost immediately.Instead, spend most of your time commenting on others\u2019 threads. By doing so, you\u2019re building yourself up as an authority within the subreddit. You\u2019re giving others your advice from experience, which is of high value on Reddit. If you only post sparingly, you\u2019ll find your post will get a better reception. That\u2019s because people will recognize you from the community, and they\u2019ll associate you with high-quality advice.Don\u2019t skimp on your comments \u2014 be as thorough as possible. Don\u2019t be afraid to leave a long comment, and make sure to continue the dialogue with anyone who replies.3) Leverage the hivemind.Reddit stands out from most other social platforms because of one unique tendency: the hivemind. This is essentially groupthink, wherein the masses tend to echo an early response.For example, if a new thread has no upvotes, a Redditor will probably want to downvote it without even reading it. Likewise, if a new thread has three upvotes, then that same Redditor will probably want to check it out. To get a better understanding of how hivemind works, check out this fantastic article from Popular Mechanics.You might be tempted to skew the initial vote count in your favor, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to use Reddit honestly and avoid underhanded tactics like buying upvotes. If you do, chances are you\u2019ll get called out on it sooner than later. Like I\u2019ve mentioned, the average Redditor has an always-on, hyper-aware bullshit detector.Instead, find ways to leverage this hivemind. See what kinds of topics get largely upvoted, and then contribute definitive guides to those topics. You can also use the hivemind to connect with Redditors. If Redditors on a certain subreddit respond to a certain idea or writing tone, then use that in your next post. As Kevin mentioned in his post, take a while to observe your subreddit of choice, and find out what makes it tick.4) For the daring \u2014 don\u2019t link to/mentioning your site.This sounds crazy at first, but it\u2019s entirely possible to get lots of traffic without even mentioning your site. There are a few reasons why:1) When you don\u2019t link to or mention your site, Redditors won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being marketed to, and that\u2019s crucial. In fact, by not mentioning your site, Redditors will want to know it.2) If the content is good enough, people will message you and ask you.3) Sometimes, people might even hunt down your site and link it themselves. I\u2019ve seen this happen many times.This is an especially powerful technique because it\u2019s so direct and organic. It\u2019s risky and has its downsides, but it should earn a place in anyone\u2019s Reddit strategy.5) Don\u2019t ask friends for help.There was only one tip from the last VYPER post on Reddit that I didn\u2019t fully gel with. It was tip number 4: getting upvotes from friends.As Kevin pointed out, upvoting rings are frowned upon, but the problem here is that the line between an upvoting ring and a few friends helping you out is really hazy. I\u2019d err on the side of caution here, but that\u2019s just me.Play By Reddit\u2019s RulesIf you take one piece of advice from this entire article, let it be this: Play by Reddit\u2019s rules. When you\u2019re posting, you\u2019re jumping into a raucous playground where the cool kids rule. To have even a small chance at being cool yourself, you have to play by their rules. It\u2019s part hazing, part scientific observation.Make sure you check out the reddiquette and follow each subreddit\u2019s rule. Do those two simple things when using Reddit, and your experience will improve by several orders of magnitude.Don\u2019t try to use Reddit to achieve marketing goals. Instead, give people tons of value, and encourage an open conversation about your brand. When done right, Reddit marketing is one of the most organic, effective ways to spread the word about your business.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide.

So we compiled a quick Q&A session to see what really moved the needle.30% of this website\u2019s revenue comes from email so you can imagine how even a small % increase email opt-in conversion rate could snowball into huge profits.1. Why did you add a popup to your website?Across all our user acquisition channels, we were sending lots of top of funnel traffic during the busiest shopping months of November and December.We added a popup to capture emails on our landing pages to make the most of this traffic. Email is one of the most import acquisition channels for us as we sell a higher priced item so conversion on the first touch point is lower than cheaper eCommerce sites.It usually takes a number of brand interactions to get the conversion. By using email we can reach these people for very little cost instead of paying for ads.2. What is your website/product about?Biostrap is the most advanced wearable platform. Our clinical-grade pulse oximetry allows deep biometric insights and full-body machine-learning algorithms are able to detect and analyze any repetitive activity that wearers perform. Visit website.3. How important are emails to your business? What do you use them for?Email capture is an integral part of our user acquisition strategy. We send out emails for sales, blog and product updates.This channel has a lot of benefits when it comes to building a relationship with your leads. Not only is acquiring the email important but the follow-up email drips and broadcasts have a huge impact on sales as well.The more emails we acquire the more we can scale our business.4. What percentage of your rev/sales comes from sending emails?About 30% of our sales come directly from emails. So optimizing our website for email collection is important and directly related to our revenue.5. What information are you collecting?Just email. We wanted to limit the information collected to enable higher conversions and reduced friction in user experience.FREE Tutorials: Access our eCom Facebook Ad Growth Hack Video Library [Here]6. What are you offering your visitors in exchange for their email?We set up the popup in such a way that everyone wins a prize. We have 8 offers on the interactive popup ranging from $10 off to free products.It is important to incentivize and offer something to your visitors as you are asking them for a favor when you show an opt-in form. The market is becoming more competitive so brands need to offer something more engaging than their competitors.7. Have you tested multiple offers before? If so, what did you test and which offer had the best conversion rate?We haven\u2019t done much testing with multiple offers. But we had an average conversion rate 8% after the switch, which we are very pleased with!We were able to 4x our conversion rate using gamification and incentivization in out popups!8. What service were you using prior to VYPER? What results were you getting?We\u2019ve augmented our current services with VYPER\u2019s offering. We are using Sumo for several popups, but we have VYPER\u2019s Interactive Popup as our default and prominent email capture on our main landing pages.We were getting a 1\u20132% popup conversion rate prior to VYPER.9. After swapping to VYPER, what was the change?After switching to VYPER for our primary means of email acquisition, we were able to 4x our popup conversion rate!We were able to capture around 25,000 emails in the span of less than 2 months.So you can see how improving your website popup can have a huge impact on the overall business and revenue.Biostrap was able to take their conversion rate from 1.5% to 8% by changing over to Interactive Popups.If they had stayed with their old popup they would have only collected 6,250 emails instead of 25,000. This can make a huge difference in your bottom line if you are monetizing your email list.Not to mention all the added sales that were driven by people winning coupon codes.You do not have to be using VYPER to achieve these benefits and results (although it definitely helps), here are some easy popup optimization adjustments you can make to your website!Let us know if you have any questions in the comments!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Conversion Rate", "Email Marketing", "Popups"]}, {"title": "Black Friday Marketing Tactics You Need To Know!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/black-friday-marketing-tactics-you-need-to-know-f66c9871bfb4?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-10-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-08", "readtime": "3.48", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Black Friday Marketing Tactics You Need To Know!VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowOct 8, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThese are the Black Friday Marketing tactics you need to know in order to have a successful Q4!Black Friday & Cyber Monday is a time of extreme joy or huge disappointment for a business.

Remember that branding and personalization of emails is super important.What is your purpose? \u2014 The reason to send an email to a list is endless but make sure your email service provider specializes in what you need. For example are you an online store trying sell physical products? Are you a SaaS company? Are you a blogger pushing affiliate offers? All of these types of online businesses have email providers that specialize in that need!Segmentation? \u2014 When you start out you will probably think \u201cfu*k it I am putting all my leads into 1 list\u201d. Then 6month later you will be like \u201cfu*k, I wish I hadn\u2019t put all my leads in 1 list\u201d. So make sure you choose a provider that can segment lists the way you need them.A list can be segmented in many ways:Number of opensNumber of clicksNumber of purchases or average order valuegender or agelocationhere are 27 other ways as wellNow that you have the knowledge to make a good decision. Here are a few we like.Klaviyo \u2014 This is THE provider to go with if you\u2019re in e-commerce. They connect directly to your Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce store (and many others) and automatically segment out everything for you. So if you wanted to do cross-sells (send an automated recommendation email to people who purchase X item), it\u2019s built into the platform. Abandon cart functionality is also built right in.The interface is very user friendly and they have a 14 day trial so always worth setting up an account and sending out some test emails to yourself to see if you like it. Also the entry level version is free. Keep all of the points above in mind while test services.Tip: If you\u2019re in e-commerce, just go with Klaviyo and make tons of $.Drip \u2014 Is a lightweight but super powerful email provider, their strongest advantage is their drip logic functionality & marketing automation features. They allow you to create pretty complete email chains based on behaviors of your customs (opened this, clicked on that etc). Their workflows function allows you to create complex decision trees depending on the actions of your user. We use Drip to power our SaaS app, VYPER. It\u2019s really great for SaaS because you can track certain actions in your app and add tags to your specific customer. As a developer, Drip is great because you can take advantage of some really killer functionality.One of their weaknesses is that they don\u2019t have a drag & drop email template builder, so you\u2019re pretty much stuck with very plain templates. That\u2019s actually shown to be great for deliverability, but it\u2019s not the best if you\u2019re an e-commerce company.Since their acquisition, Drip has rolled out a starter package for 100 emails at only $1 per month. That\u2019s not as cheap as Mailchimp\u2019s 2,000 free starter package, but you\u2019re getting much stronger functionality with Drip.Tip: If your email list requires complex decision trees (like a SaaS app might), then Drip was built for you.ConvertKit \u2014 Is email marketing automation for bloggers. They\u2019ve decided to focus primarily on writers & bloggers, and their feature set makes it easy for bloggers & content writers to attract new leads. For example, one nifty feature is that if your reader has already been subscribed to your list, the ConvertKit form shows your Facebook like button or some other code instead.But the real reason you want to go with ConvertKit is because it\u2019s VERY simple to understand and gets you email automation without a huge learning curve. Click triggers allow you to tag certain customers so you can send email directly to those customers, or it can move certain customers to different sequences.You don\u2019t have some of the complex functionality as Drip, but this makes it really easy for the blogger to start using it. And for 99% of bloggers, ConvertKit is enough to get started because you\u2019re not dealing with the decision trees you might be with a SaaS (for example, readers of a blog don\u2019t usually have to login and get onboarded to an app \u2014 these kinds of complex actions are best handled within Drip).And for bloggers, your emails are going to be primarily content, not images, so ConvertKit is fine for you. ConvertKit doesn\u2019t have a fancy template builder, so be prepared to send plain text looking emails.Tip: If you\u2019re a blogger, ConvertKit gets you a leg up from Campaign Monitor and Mailchimp with some powerful segmentation and tagging features.Campaign Monitor \u2014 Is a service that that a lot of agencies or resellers use as they have integrated a white label account pretty successfully. On top of this they also have a pretty good selection of templated emails and a/b split testing of emails. To me they compete head to head with Mailchimp because they\u2019re cheaper and have basic functionality, but aren\u2019t as advanced as the options above.They\u2019re starting to add some e-commerce functionality, but it\u2019s still in beta, and nowhere near as sophisticated as Klaviyo\u2019s.These guys are a good option if you plan to have clients that will also need to send out their own branded emails.Tip: They\u2019re a slightly better version of Mailchimp that doesn\u2019t have a free tier.Mailchimp \u2014 One of the most popular email provider services due to it\u2019s free account up to 2,000 subscribers. Even though these guys start out cheap the cost starts to mount once you grow. They definitely work the price back in further down the line.Having said that these guys have been around FOREVER so they know what they are doing with a/b testing, good email tracking, ok list segmentation and great design templates. One thing to watch out for is, if you are an affiliate this service provider is pretty strict on affiliate links so be careful!Overall Mailchimp is a provider that does a lot of things decently, although they\u2019re not a standout in any category. If you have more specialized needs, we recommend an ESP that is more suited for your particular market.Tip: If you just need a general newsletter, you don\u2019t need advanced functionality, or you\u2019re starting out, Mailchimp is a good option for you. Once you have to start paying for Mailchimp (past their free tier) it\u2019s best to move to a more sophisticated ESP.SummaryHopefully after reading this you are much more knowledgable on what you need to look for to find the best email provider for YOU. People will make recommendations based on their affiliate links and what not but you just need to take a step back and think of that provider offers everything I need?If you have a provider you are doing that you think should be mentioned on this list, let us know in the comments and we can add it!", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "What is a Viral Giveaway?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-set-up-a-viral-giveaway-3def75525ad4?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-08-13", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-06", "readtime": "3.02", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "What is a Viral Giveaway?VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 13, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readEvery business needs sales to survive but unfortunately it is getting harder and harder to convince people to buy a product the first time they see it or visit your website. True direct response is getting harder, especially for companies in SaaS where the product might take a long time to explain. To go from the first exposure to the sale usually requires 4\u20137 touch points.One solution to this is using viral giveaways, which are used to incentive the behavior of sharing and increasing the exposure of your brand to get that introductory touch point with little effort.A viral giveaway works like this:John has a shoe store and wants to giveaway a pair of shoes to incentivize people to sign up to his email list so he can send them deals every week.Sam signs up and enters his email to get 1 entry to win the shoes.On the confirmation page Sam is given a custom link to share with his friends and family, on social or via email for example.When Sam\u2019s friends or family sign up to also win the shoes through his custom link he will get additional entries.As you can see above the methods allow for 1 entrant to refer a whole lot more people.Why You Should Run a Viral GiveawayThe cost per lead is super low (we have seen them as low as $0.05 per email).Using the right giveaway prize can draw in super targeted leads.The entrant is incentivized to share their email and the company gets cheap leads, win win.This strategy can be evergreen, some companies run a monthly giveaway and the giveaway page generates more and more authority month after month.With the use of paid media this strategy is easy to scale.Giveaway Traps to AvoidGiving away prizes not relevant to your niche.Not promoting the giveaway. First 2\u20133 weeks need WORK!Being too self promotional when promoting.How to Set Up a Viral GiveawayChoose a prize that is relevantThis is extremely important and we see first time giveaway users choose prizes that do not make sense. For example a dentistry giving away an iPad. The prize needs to be complimentary to what you sell so your giveaway entries are aligned with your business and can be converted at a later date. Read more about choosing the right prize here.Plan your outreachThis step is extremely important. You will need to email other influencers and ask for their help in promoting your giveaway. It is usually best to send this out to your industry friends and remember that the favor will be reciprocal.Leverage your current audience.Just because you already have someone\u2019s email, doesn\u2019t mean you can not leverage this person further. Your email list and social media are a great place to start. If you have a segmented list of passionate super fans email them separately with a more person message (these are the guys that will make or break a giveaway). Even though you already have your email lists\u2019 emails, they are likely to know others just like them who they can share the giveaway with.LaunchThis is the easiest step, hit the launch button, send out all your outreach emails, post to all of your social media and blast your email list. All of these steps have been pre planned so shouldn\u2019t take too long.Manage your entriesAs the giveaway builds momentum, check-in on the types of emails you are getting. Look at the source referring most traffic and find other sites or influencers like that to reach out to.Continue to promoteIt is a good idea to start with a media spend on your giveaway. This gets the ball rolling and shows your giveaway to the right audience from the get go. The trick is to aim for a low CPC and use pixels or goals to track the sign ups a paid media channel is driving. We usually start out by publishing some ads on Facebook, Stumble, LinkedIn, Reddit and Twitter.Sooo ready to take the next step?Create your giveaway at VYPER.

This is a feature that can make or break the success of a campaign. Essentially this feature gives you the opportunity to reward your contest entrants for doing ANYTHING! Below is a list of the best custom entries to use in your contest! We have examples from some huge brands that used this feature to get some huge results that outperformed any campaign they had done before!So we know that custom entries are important. They allow you to set a question/task for your entrants. This is super handy as you can use this system to game \u201corganic\u201d actions.A few of our favorite custom entries are below and will help you grow your business in all areas, not just your email list!1 \u2014 Comment, like and share our Facebook postThis is a fantastic way to increase the validation of your social posts. All you are doing is rewarding a few entries into your contest for doing so instead of having to pay Facebook for an engagement campaign.PRO TIP \u2014 chose a post that you are running ads to. This will increase the engagement on your paid post and get you a better relevancy score as well as improve your CPM which should lead to lower conversion rates and higher click-through rates.Here are some Facebook ad results from a recent client that used this technique. This is prospecting traffic as well (does not include remarketing, past purchase or any of that other stuff that the Guru\u2019s try and trick you with)!2 \u2014 Read a blog post and leave a commentThis was used by Foundr Magazine to drive engagement and readers to their blog. They chose a popular post and got people to read the post, comment and share it. It is now the most commented on a blog post with some of the highest shares and traffic numbers.For the question, ask them what their main takeaway was from the blog post. Or you can ask them, \u201cwhat was the blog post about\u201d.PRO TIP \u2014 By asking for feedback on the post you can also relay this to the content team to see what people thought about the post. Incorporate that feedback into your next blog post.Read bout Foundr\u2019s contest with VYPER here.3 \u2014 Join our Facebook groupThis was used by Scotts Cheap Flights to grow his Facebook group to huge numbers. All you are doing is sending people to your Facebook group to join then asking them a question such as, what is your Facebook username?This is great because a group has a much better reach than a Facebook page. So any future posts in your group will reach more people.PRO TIP \u2014 this can be used to grow any community, a slack channel, subreddit etc.4 \u2014 Subscribe to Facebook Messenger UpdatesHow do you get your customers to notice you and listen to what you have to say? Connect with them on multiple channels and make sure your message gets through.This custom entry is perfect for building a second \u201cemail\u201d alternative. The open rates are over 80% and CTR\u2019s can be above $20\u201330%, when was the last time you saw that in an email?So the idea here is to use a service such as ManyChat or ChatFuel to manager the messages etc. You will want to create a signup page with the service (takes 15seconds) then take that link and use it in the customs entry of your contest!PRO TIP \u2014 have an automated messenger sequence setup so that when someone signs up they receive Facebook messages about your brand\u2019s offers, products, promotions, news, interest facts, industry secrets, niche benchmarks.Always remember to add value, the world is not about you, it is about the customer so make them feel like it!If you can\u2019t prove value, at least entertain them with funny gifs and cute dog photos!5 \u2014 Show us some love on Product HuntThis contest custom entry can be used for any platform where you are submitting your product or service. A few of the big ones are Product Hunt, BetaList, The Awesomer, Cool Material, Incredible Things and good old Reddit.Ideally, this custom entry allows you to incentivize people to upvote or like your listing which increases your ranking in these communities.PRO TIP \u2014 use a contest in conjunction with the new launch of your product or service. It is a great way to build traffic, awareness as well as grow your email list and social accounts.We have also had a few customers using this method to build exposure and market their initial coin offering (ICO) which has been interesting and one of the top ones resulting in over 85k entrants.FREE Checklist: 17 Unique Ways To Promote Your Next Contest [Here]5 \u2014 Complete this quick surveyOne thing that companies do not do enough is listen or even ask customers what they want. Peoples time is valuable so in a lot of cases, you need to incentivize them to share their opinion a contest custom entry is perfect for this (you do not have to give discounts or cash to get feedback).PRO TIP \u2014 Share that feedback with developers, content creators and onboarding product team. This will help them understand the5 \u2014 Sign up for our eventThis one is a little more specific for local business so the contest promotion channels need to be relevant.Essentially this custom entry will incentivize people to at least look at your event and consider it. Just create the question and drop the link to your Eventbrite or Facebook event and get people to register.PRO TIP \u2014 offer some sort of bonuses if they actually attend, this will make sure that people do not just signup and not attend. A few users of VYPER have run a contest and then said they will announce the winner at the event.6 \u2014 Sign up for our webinar/web summitThis one is a little more scalable than a physical event and we had the company \u201cLaunch Summit\u201d execute on this custom entry perfectly. They created a contest and had the custom entry to signup to their Launch Web Summit.Signing up was free and they made money on upselling VIP tickets (getting access to speakers and replays).This was the event they were promoting \u2014 take a look at the Eventbrite listing.Here is another article how this company also used VYPER to generate $55k to fund their web summit.PRO TIP \u2014 make sure you mention the speakers, value of the summit and more in the contest description to build the desire for somone to attend. By using a Leaderboard contest, this user was also giving away VIP tickets to whoever collected the most entries from sharing the summit!PROEST TIP \u2014 Another growth hack for this custom entry was to use it to build hype around Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. This build up awareness around the deals so that when the hour struck 00:01 am you had an army of people waiting to buy. Example Here7 \u2014 Re-gram our Instagram photo, then tag @company-nameThis works well for ecom physical products, the most famous example is the \u201cred bathing suit\u201d company. They get a huge amount of people to re-gram an image of the product they were giving away.The question you would want to ask is. What is your Instagram handle or what is the URL to your re-gram?So if you\u2019re looking to really make your next contest go viral.

He acquired the business from Sujan Patel, another well-known marketer in the digital marketing space. Before being the head honcho at Single Grain, he was the marketing lead for Treehouse, one of the most well-known companies in the tech education space.He also owns Growth Everywhere, now one of my favorite podcasts in the startup growth space. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed listening to all his interviews with some of the top entrepreneurs in the world.YOUR LINK TEXTNote: This article was originally published on HYPERLUSH, and has been republished here with permission.We got a chance to interview Eric about one of his favorite topics, content marketing. It\u2019s one of the most effective ways to build up a loyal audience, and it\u2019s an extremely good way to build up an email list.What was the challenge coming into Single Grain after working in a company like Treehouse?It\u2019s a completely different company. With Single Grain, we don\u2019t necessarily have anything groundbreaking. We\u2019re a digital marketing agency just like tons of agencies out there. With Treehouse, we had a great team and a great product and we were on the cutting edge of the education space. Our team at Single Grain is also a different team \u2014 we have a lot of smart people at Single Grain but they\u2019re mostly junior marketers. It was unlike Treehouse where we had the A-class team with people from places like Stanford & Google. So it\u2019s a different challenge.Let\u2019s get into content marketing. How does one even get started?There\u2019s one really important thing that people forget. You have to write for yourself. Write what speaks to you and then go for you. If it\u2019s not interesting for you then you\u2019re not going to help anyone. As Mark Cuban said, \u201cYou try to please everyone, you please no one.\u201dAlso you just gotta keep writing. At the beginning you\u2019re going to see very little returns. It\u2019s a delayed gratification. It\u2019s like compound interest. Over time you\u2019ll see your traffic grow. You\u2019ll see your email list grow.Do you write with SEO in mind?It\u2019s very helpful to understand SEO, but you don\u2019t want to make your writing very robotic by including X amount of keywords in the title or article. It\u2019s important to get traction in your article first and then you can go back and tweak things for SEO purposes.Bottom line: learn the basics of SEO, but don\u2019t worry about over optimization.You have two properties, Single Grain and Growth Everywhere. What\u2019s the purpose of this?I intended to start Growth Everywhere just to give back. When I made it two years ago, I just wanted to make it helpful. But Growth Everywhere does help us send people into our marketing funnels for Single Grain. (Single Grain being the marketing company and Growth Everywhere being just a content blog/podcast for startup growth). We do find that Growth Everywhere brings in our best clients, because they are high value customers who understand more than the average customer and they see the value of what we provide. So in that sense, yes, Growth Everywhere is a great channel for us to find customers for Single Grain.Can you give us traffic numbers for your two properties?Across the board we\u2019re getting around 80,000 unique visitors. About 5% of our audience turns into newsletter subscribers, so we\u2019re getting about 4,000 per month.Wow, that\u2019s pretty high. How are you getting 5% of your readers into newsletter subscribers?I highly recommend ConversionXL for more conversion tips. But our welcome mat from SumoMe is converting super well \u2014 at around 10%. We also have lead magnets that do really well, around 5%.Sumo Me Welcome MatWhat\u2019s doing REALLY well is we have article-specific lead magnets that convert up to 10\u201315%, or commonly called \u201ccontent upgrades.\u201d(Editor\u2019s note, to learn more about content upgrades, check out this post by Backlinko).Did you do A/B testing? And at what point does someone need to do A/B testing?Yes we definitely A/B tested our offers. So generally we tested the actual offers, not the color of the button or something like that.As far as when you should start A/B testing, I have an arbitrary number, 10k uniques. If you don\u2019t have that many yet, then you have much need for A/B testing. And you also have a lot more issues that will take more precedent.You have a site-wide lead magnet called 29 Growth Hacking Quick Wins. How did you come up with this and why did you think it would be a compelling lead magnet?Yeah so the content of that e-book was mostly created by Mattan Griffel of One Month. We were at a conference together and I really liked the content he put together. So I approached him to do the design and he said yes so we created the e-book together.For our audience it was just a no-brainer. If they could get just one good tip from the e-book then it\u2019s worth it for them. We put this lead magnet up on our welcome mat and also throughout our website and it\u2019s been converting a lot better than what was on there before.What\u2019s converting best for you? Welcome mat? Popup? Exit popup?The Welcome Mat by far. So it converts around 10%. We also have an exit popup but it only converts at 1%. I have no idea about the psychology behind it, but the Welcome Mat is just doing so much better. I\u2019d definitely test it out.(Editor\u2019s note: SumoMe themselves have reported similar data. That their Welcome Mat does a lot better than any other pop-up or optin form).How do you promote your content?We find communities that we can post our content to \u2014 places like Growth Hackers and Inbound.org. There\u2019s also Reddit and Hacker News. Then we had our team upvote the content as well. That gave our initial boost of traffic. Then we also interviewed influencers who sent us traffic.Combine that with a mailing list and you slowly end up growing your list and audience pretty quickly.For the people who are having trouble converting their traffic to email subscribers, what should they do?You have to go back to the drawing board and ask yourself if your content is actually good. In general, it\u2019s mostly people who want to take shortcuts and be lazy. When you\u2019re creating content you have to provide value. If it doesn\u2019t provide value then you won\u2019t convert traffic.So take a really deep, hard look at your content and ask yourself if the value you\u2019re providing is actually good. In the past I\u2019ve honestly said \u201cno\u201d to this many times. It\u2019s a learning process. You have to continually create more and more content and figure out what content resonates and what content falls flat.How can we get feedback to see if our content is good or not?Start with friends and family first. Facebook ads can help you see if people want to look at your content. Just look and see which ads get the highest CTR so you can see what people are clicking on and what they like.The great part about this strategy is not only do you get to see what content converts well, but now you can pixel your audience with the FB pixel. Once you have that FB pixel on your site, you can now retarget that audience so they can buy an offer from your site, maybe a cheap offer. Then you can bring them deeper into your funnel and purchase more higher value products.I highly recommend DigitalMarketer.com for more insights on Facebook ads strategy and growth in general.Thanks so much for all the insights Eric!To learn more about Eric Siu, check him out at:Growth EverywhereSingle GrainTwitterOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/the-best-growth-hackers-in-the-world-arent-necessarily-going-around-teaching-their-skills-211112585c27?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-06", "readtime": "6.16", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 20, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readVincent Dignan: An Underground Growth Hacker\u2019s Tactics to Getting Free TrafficThe best growth hackers in the world aren\u2019t necessarily going around teaching their skills. They\u2019re usually just making tons of money for themselves. A few of them consult with other companies for thousands of dollars per month. That\u2019s what Vincent Dignan was doing for years before he recently decided to reveal his secrets in a tell-all book entitled \u201cSecret Sauce.\u201dThe reason that Vincent has decided to stay underground and not reveal his secrets for so many years is because growth hacking channels die when too many people use them. How many users are now posting inspirational quotes on Instagram to try and \u201cgrowth hack\u201d that platform? How many people are using Auto-DM and Auto-Follow on Twitter? These hacks still work, but they\u2019re no longer as effective since you see it all too commonly now.That\u2019s why to this day, he still doesn\u2019t reveal his best tactics. In fact the people who do reveal their tactics end up making it harder for themselves because those tactics end up overused. The best growth hackers experiment relentlessly to get ahead of the curve, and then exploit the hacks ruthlessly before they\u2019re found out.But we got an exclusive with Vincent to talk about a few of the tactics that are still working now, and how he creatively uses Twitter and other channels to get free targeted traffic for his clients and his own projects.You went from being broke and on welfare 4 years ago, now you\u2019re giving growth hacking talks, how did you gain those skills in that time?Yeah at the time, around 2012, I was homeless living with an ex-girlfriend. I didn\u2019t have my own place and was living off her.My ex told me I needed to go do something. So I decided to make an online magazine since I enjoyed writing and figured I wouldn\u2019t make money blogging off Tumblr. Within 6 months the magazine had 350,000 visitors per month. Within a year it had a million. We raised about $250,000 and got into the Techstars accelerator program. Soon later after that I was giving talks.Wow, amazing. But it sounds like you had no knowledge of the digital world before this. So how did you get up to 350,000 visitors so fast?One of the things I believe is you should learn from one of the best. At the time I wanted to start an online magazine so I talked with a girl who worked for a successful magazine and got advice from her. She told me just get as much traffic as you can \u2014 the rest will fall into place.So the first thing I did was call every University in the country and told them we were building the coolest magazine in the world and would you like to be apart of it. So in essence it was user generated content but we had editors to make the content look good. But the idea is to generate as many articles as possible.Then our strategy was to hit up as many people as possible \u2014 send it through news sites, social communities like Reddit, send it to large publications, send it to people via social media. Our articles got picked up by places like the Huffington Post and other sites like that, which drove massive traffic.We also growth hacked our way with Twitter and got tons of traffic that way (editor\u2019s note, we\u2019ll talk more about Twitter later on in the article).Another thing we did was we used a widget called Zergnet that was essentially a traffic exchange. Every time we send them 1 visitor they send us 2 back. So that was extremely good.You eventually made the transition from PlanetIvy to a growth hacking consultancy called Magnific, why?We got a lot of offers from other companies to learn how we were doing what we were doing. All the stuff we learned growing our Twitter, growing our traffic, that\u2019s stuff that companies wanted. The offers were too good to pass up. It made sense at that point to turn Planet Ivy into our own agency, Magnific.Another main reason for the transition \u2014 when we started in 2012, it was easier to get advertising dollars from publishing. Even with a lot of traffic, an ad-supported website is getting harder to do, especially now with Facebook dominating online advertising. Now Facebook has such a monopoly on traffic that most publications just can\u2019t compete with that kind of targeting and reach.At the same time I still work on side projects just to keep myself interested while I\u2019m helping clients grow their businesses. Secret Sauce, my book has been my biggest project this year. We wanted to create something for the people that can\u2019t afford our services, which cost thousands of dollars. I also created a Facebook group called \u201ctraffic and copy,\u201d which now has a few thousand people.You have a book on Kickstarter that was recently funded successfully (to the tune of $80k+). What was your marketing process for getting sales off Kickstarter?We first compiled a list of several different marketing channels then we arranged them from easiest to hardest.The list looked something like this:Compile a list of people we know and let them know about the book \u2014 Linkedin contacts, Twitter, email contacts.Accelerators and coworking spaces that I\u2019ve talked at, I asked them to send things out to their newsletter. These all have pretty good newsletters that are tech/startup focused.Hacker News \u2014 we couldn\u2019t do this channel as well.Posts on Reddit did really well \u2014 self posts. (Editor\u2019s note: Use Reddit converter to convert your blogs into self posts formatted for Reddit).Posting in Facebook groups.Interviewed on about 8 podcasts, get them to do interviews like this one.Reached out to some influencers to try and get referrals, although this didn\u2019t help as much.Did talks throughout America during the launch.Our pre-existing mailing list.My partner Austin wrote a Medium article that got a lot of traffic.Then send them to a queueing system, we used Queue At to do this. You got a free chapter of the book if you signed up. This queue system asked you to share the book\u2019s landing page in exchange for moving up the queue. As you moved up the queue you could get free webinars, free consultancies, free blog posts about your company, etc. This was definitely the key to the whole thing since it gave us a lot of viral shares.Then we launched and we made about $15,000 from the first day, and now over $80,000 from Kickstarter.You\u2019ve done a lot of growth hacking around Twitter. Can you share the basics about how you use Twitter for traffic?First of all I signed up several different accounts. I recommend beginners to start with 4 accounts \u2014 you could do it like @company_name, @company_help, @company_usa, @company_country \u2014 something like that.Then make sure you\u2019re tweeting a LOT. I tweet on all my accounts every 30 minutes. Twitter isn\u2019t like Facebook. You need repetition to get your content out there.I have an intern Tweeting for me.I don\u2019t use automation currently, but in the past I\u2019ve used Audiense to automate the replies.I follow people with certain attributes. Currently this isn\u2019t automated because my intern does it, although there are tools like Follow Liker that can do that for you.Find a conference going on in your niche and follow those people. They\u2019re super active so they tend to follow back.Don\u2019t follow more than 500 people a day & unfollow more than 400 people a day.Don\u2019t send more than 250 tweets a day.I post and find interesting content.How did you start getting a lot of speaking engagements? That\u2019s sort of a growth hack in itself isn\u2019t it?Yeah I was randomly asked to talk at an accelerator and they were going to pay me for it. From there it was just by referral. Someone there wanted me to talk at another place, and then so on and so forth.One other thing I did to get speaking engagements was just hit up the organizer to various startup meetups in my area (through Meetups.com), give them a deck I had on growth hacking, and do a cold email asking if I could speak.You mention on your site that forums are where you learn real growth hacks. What forums do you go on?BlackHatWorld.com. It\u2019s black hat but they have a lot of amazing tactics on there.The thing with blackhat, of course, is that the hacks don\u2019t really last, but they\u2019ll be doing stuff that gets them tons of traffic for a time, until Google finds out and destroys it. So you can\u2019t make a real business out of it, but you can get some temporary wins from Blackhat.However, the site itself has actually tons of really good advice that\u2019s not Blackhat, so I recommend people checking it out.What\u2019s a last growth hack you want to share with our audience?The key really is knowing that there are tools out there for anything. A lot of stuff can be automated and a lot of knowledge and info can be scraped.CharlieApp \u2014 Finds anyone\u2019s info.Audiense \u2014 Automated Twitter/Instagram mentions and scrape Twitter/Instagram for certain keywords.Email Hunter \u2014 Find email addresses.Depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve, there\u2019s going to be a way for you to reach people without spending a lot of time or money.Check out more of Vincent Dignan:His book Secret Sauce on IndieGogoVincentDignan.comMagnific agencyTwitterOriginally published at vyper.io on August 20, 2016.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Growth Hacking", "Startup", "Traffic", "Vincent Dignan"]}, {"title": "CASE STUDY \u2014 4,142 New Emails & A Successful Indigogo Launch Using Viral Contests", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-4-142-new-emails-a-successful-indigogo-launch-using-viral-contests-381c04347f58?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-10-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-28", "readtime": "4.51", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "CASE STUDY \u2014 4,142 New Emails & A Successful Indigogo Launch Using Viral ContestsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowOct 14, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readSummary \u2014 we sat down with Nick from Healy Sleep to talk about his recent VYPER campaign.

Not to mention the boost he got for his Indiegogo campaign and huge social media growth.Take a look behind the scenes of a winning campaign as we do a super direct no BS question and answer session about what works, what didn\u2019t and what Nick would do next time round!1.

What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work?We\u2019ve tried working with micro influencers, but our lead quality was poor and our Cost Per Acquisition was usually too high.3. What has been your top converting channel for collecting email leads to date?Facebook and VYPER have been the best channels for collecting leads.With less than $150 of Facebook spend we were able to collect over 4k leads through our VYPER campaign.4. Why did you decide to run a contest?We wanted to run a contest for a number of reasons but these were the main ones.Generate buzz for our official Indiegogo launchLeverage strategic partnerships (other sleep related products)Utilize the VYPER viral engine for easy growthIncrease exposure in our target audience segmentsGenerate warm leads (people interested in our product)See contest HEREFREE Download: 6 Key Learnings from collecting 7k emails from 1 contest [Click Here]5. What marketing problems were you facing?When working with a limited marketing budget it can be difficult to acquire high quality leads at reasonable prices. We needed a way to get free (or cheap) exposure and saw contests as a good opportunity.6. What were your goals or growth needed to deem the marketing campaign successful?Our goal was to accumulate 2,000 or more email addressesSpend less than $200 on paid mediaEstablish partnerships with complementary companies that we could work with again in the future.7.

What are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?The type of prizes/rewards you use is paramount (people have to want them enough to work for them). Meaning put some serious though into your prize structure.Tiered contests with multiple winners are best.Bundling products is an effective way to increase exposure.Leveraging paid ads can result in a nice viral lift (use designed images like the ones below)Communicate with your list to encourage more activity.9. What would you do next time you ran a contest?We worked with a dozen other brands. This was hugely helpful in that it made the rewards more attractive.Unfortunately, only a few of our partners were helpful at spreading/promoting the contest.It\u2019s critical for each partner to share the contest on their social channels and with their email list. If everyone shares, it inevitably benefits everyone involved.If no one shares, no one benefits so pick good partners and have a series of emails ready to send your partners. Include copy and images for them to use for their social posts and emails to make it super easy for them to do.Add our Google Analytics code to our contest page to get more campaign insights.10. How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?Facebook adsFacebook organic (posting)Twitter tweet & engagementInstagram postsPartners help in promoting the contest on their social channels (could have been better with more of this!)Several contest aggregators (not sure if this did anything\u2026)Used this image across social media accounts:11.

Simple, they advertise the features of their product or service and provide value. Sounds easy right?Not so fast, I forgot to mention you have to compete against almost every other business trying to also win over your customers attention.So how do you get the attention of your potential customers and beat out your competitors.Simple, you run engaging, value add Facebook ads!This is the basic flow of an awesome lead generation machine.-> Facebook Ad \u2192 Valuable Content / Sales Page \u2014 -> Free Content Upgrade / Lead Bait \u2014 \u2192 Email Drip \u2014 \u2014 -> Lifelong Customer / Reader :)Below is a number of Facebook ads that I tear apart and pinpoint the things these companies did right and the things they royally f \u2018d up. I will share what makes some of these the best Facebook ads in their niche.So How Have These B2B Companies Created The Best Facebook Ads?Facebook Ad 1 \u2014 FoxleyLanding Page \u2014 https://members.foxley.com/393-webinarThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 They are using [brackers] to draw you attention the most important aspect of the ad, the FREE video training they want you to sign up to.Image \u2014 There is a huge amount of eye contact which grabs people\u2019s attention and the use of yellow in the background and CTA draw your attention to click the image which then redirects to the ads final URL.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They did not include a link in the ad text for an extra CTA option, this also makes the post look a little more organic even though they went way overboard on the CAPS.Image \u2014 The text in the image is well over theFacebook Ad 2 \u2014 Lead QuizzesLanding Page \u2014 http://lps.leadquizzes.com/the-3-types-of-quiz-funnels-1The Pros to This AdText \u2014 They are using statistics and numbers to lure you in to find out more. This is a great technique to tie in with case studies, educational content and in this case a webinar as well.Image \u2014 The color definitely stands out in the news feed and makes people stop and read. Using interesting looking people is a great tactic for grabbing someone\u2019s attention (e.g. strange hair color, covered in tattoos, doing a strange pose, body out of proportion etc).The Cons to This AdText \u2014 For business owners 50,000 leads to only generate $100k is not that good, that\u2019s only $2 AOV (average order value) or rev per lead and it does not say how much it cost to acquire a customer.They should have left this at 50,000 leads or used $100k/m in revenue.Image \u2014 The image is super strong but the copy in the image lets this ad down. The text is not very interesting and a bit of a sell out that the secret is their own product. It should have been tied in with the text \u201cMy Secret to Generating 50k leads in 1 month?\u201d then CTA \u2014 \u201cLearn How\u201d.Facebook Ad 3 \u2014 Neil PatelLanding Page \u2014 http://neilpatel.com/podcast/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 This sponsored post is a much more organic looking ad. The text is long and can be expanded as well as including more of a pain point/story instead of a direct response sales pitch.Image \u2014 Neil is lucky enough to be able to use images of himself to get clicks as one of his strongest assets is the personal brand he has built around himself. Again this image plays on the more organic looking feel as an image like this looks like a post from a friend not a company trying to take your money.Again this image plays on the more organic looking feel as an image like this looks like a post from a friend, not a company trying to take your money.The Cons to This AdText -This looks to be a boosted link post as there is no CTA almost all of the text is getting cut off. Get familiar with the character limits from Facebook and try and stick to them when writing/ editing link titles and text.Image -Even though this is an image of Neil which holds a lot of authority, the image could have been more focused on him. Meaning a more neutral/solid color background, less blurred towards the bottom of the image.The landscape sizing was also a bad choice, this image should have been square which allows more space to be taken up in the news feed.Facebook Ad 4 \u2014 Fatboy MarketingLanding Page \u2014 https://www.fatboyinc.com/blog/how-to-not-suck-at-google-adwordsThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This Facebook ad has a fantastic emotional appeal, nobody wants to suck at something and it immediately grabs your attention as the viewer takes offense and it provokes emotion.The copy is also extreamly direct in the goal ofImage \u2014 There is a huge amount of eye contact which grabs people\u2019s attention and the use of yellow in the background and CTA draw your attention to click the image which then redirects to the ads final URL.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 Not a huge amount of cons here but they could have made the call to action a little strong. They build up the emotion and pain point but really tell you to click on the ad to solve it. This may be obvious to mostThis may be obvious to most but always better to base than sorry. Remember, you want to tell the viewer what the pain point is (get in their mindset, they need to relate) and then tell them why/how you are going to solve it for them.Image \u2014 The \u201chow to\u201d could have been a little bigger and still stayed within the 20% (meaning they would not get penalized. The other observation is not to use the colors similar to the Facebook blue. Your ads tend to blend and get lost in the platform.Facebook ad 5 \u2014 Digital MarketerLanding Page -The Pros to This AdText \u2014 Again this ad is using statistics to add credibility. They are also very confident and to the point about what they are offing.Image \u2014 They draw your attention the title straight away with the red banner. They are also aligning the text really well with the image using the \u201clibrary\u201d theme.The Cons to This AdText -They could have positioned this a little more towards a question e.g. \u2014 \u201cWant to see and copy the exact ads that we used to generate 400k+ leads and millions of dollars?\u201d. People want the get rich quick method (copy someone or something) most of the time so you need to give it to them!Image \u2014 The image is very busy, if possible they could have spaced it out a little more and added a strong shadow under the red banner to make it pop forward. Using eye illusions is fantastic in ads. Check here for some inspiration.Facebook ad 6 \u2014 Posi RankLanding Page 6 \u2014 http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/devsecops/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 The ad creates a ton of curiosity if this is served to a super targeted audience that understands the backlink ecosystem they have done a good job in encouraging a click to learn more.Image \u2014 Very clever and creative ad image, the use of flat images has made it a lot easier to get messaging across through visuals. This is a much better approach than a stock image of a guy at a computer smiling.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 These guys missed a huge opportunity to use the ad text section. They definitely should have used this as it is not really clear what you are clicking to receive or see.This ad does create mystery however not a great job a pre-qualifying the user. You can either target a wide audience with a general ad for top of the funnel traffic (usually expensive) or create a targeted ad/audience to prequalify people (usually cheaper if done right).Image \u2014 People know that is probably an ad by looking at the \u201csponsored\u201d tag and they are probably targeting tech savvy people. But the logo in the top left is completely out of place and does not fit into the image at all. This is a huge red light for people clicking as it decreases their creative design credibility.If you are going to add a logo to our images for branding make them subtle. This logo takes the users attention away from the messaging of the ad and makes them notice the logo tag straight away.Facebook ad 7 \u2014 Trend MicroLanding Page 7 \u2014 http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/devsecops/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 This is a super interesting ad as they are going above and beyond with the \u201chook\u201d. They offer a reward and prompt the browser to \u201ctest\u201d their knowledge which actually means fill out a survey for us!Image \u2014 You can see that his brand has done a much better job at integrating their logo. They have also integrated messaging within the image. The quiz is provoked by the thinking pilot, they have also connected the dots with cloud security and an everyday understandable industry.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They needed to define AWS a little more and also include why cloud security is important. They needed to make the user care about cloud security, using fear probably would have been the best in this case.e.g. Worried about your website being hacked? , Is your website safe? , Is your website protecting your customer\u2019s personal information?Image \u2014 This is a fantastic image for this ads as it has all the bells and whistles to get someone to click. The only thing they messed up was pilot not looking at the CTA. If they had just lowered the pilot a little more in the image so his line of sight was pointing towards the CTA they would have nailed it!Facebook ad 8 \u2014 I Love SaaSLanding Page 8 \u2014 http://www.moneypath.com/saas-funnel-metrics-gogThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has used past accomplishments as a validator. An ad can be similar to a resume in the fact that you have to tell your audience what you have achieved and how you can help them.Image \u2014 This ad has also used a more personal approach by making himself the figure of the business. He has also carried the image from the landing page to the ad so the funnel has a logical flow.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 The text has not been split out into paragraphs. The book is free but this is not included the in the main title. It has included that a 10 question survey is required. This sounds like a chore compared to a lead magnet. It should have been positioned as a 2minIt should have been positioned as a 2min quiz to find out your Saas companies key metrics. The quiz could have been the driving point of this ad to add value. Instead, it is positioned as a barrier to get the free content.Image \u2014 Even though the ad is personal and carries through to the landing page he should have used a set image not a screenshot from the video. Or even included teh video as the ad to speed up the funnel and ad value faster. Facebook also give more reach to video content over image content.Facebook ad 9 \u2014 PercolateLanding Page 9 \u2014 https://percolate.com/request-demoThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has hit the pain point jackpot, most people hate spreadsheets and find them extremely painful and time-consuming. For this fact alone if you work in a business you are interested. The question also creates interest.Image \u2014 They have used a carousel that gives you more information before the click.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They have duplicated the copy across all the carousel images which is a huge wasted opportunity. This could have been a section to explain the product more or highlight the key benefits of the software.Image \u2014 Even though they have the right idea to add more imagery they have gone with some pretty boring stock looking images that are not really going to drive interest.They could have made the carousel into a storyboard showing the person with the pain (you) and then the service being the solution to that pain point.Facebook ad 10 \u2014 Click FunnelsLanding Page 10 \u2014 https://dotcomsecretslabs.com/free-bookThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has so many value bombs in it (statistics that scare you, free product and testimonial). This copy is bound to stop anyone who has a website and knows that conversion rate and sales are key success factors for their business.It also scares the browser by stating that 1 word decreased converions by 31%. Browsers thought process goes \u201cWait a second, do I also have 1 word costing me 30% of my revenue\u201d.Image \u2014 Unlike the ad above Click Funnels has used the video on option and boy do they have a lot of engagement on this ad which means it is probably working and they have a super cheap CPC and CPA.Remember in terms of engagement \u201cshares are the golden goose\u201d.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 Hard to find many things wrong with this one but the title is probably the weakest point. They could have made it a little more impactful by using the stats in the text or playing into the fear of something costing you 30% of your sales.Something like \u201cFind Out Why this Landing Page Decreased my Sales by 31%\u201dImage \u2014 Again this ad could have used an image instead of a screen grab from the video. You can add text to the image and come across as a little more authoritative. Remember to keep your first frame of a video under 20% text.So now you have a pretty good understanding of what makes the best Facebook ads work. The key takeaways are.Always try and use emotion to encourage a clickYour image has the largest statistical difference when testing adsUsing faces and humans can make your ads more relatableAlways identify a pain pointRemember all the browser/potential customer wants to know is how you can save them time or money.If you run your own Facebook ads definitely check out the FREE offer below as it will drastically help improve your CPA\u2019s and CPC\u2019s.Get Access To Our Facebook Hacks Video Library.Click HERE!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "13 Ways To Growth Hack Using Viral Leaderboard Contests", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/13-ways-to-growth-hack-using-viral-leaderboard-contests-150169e12a22?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-07-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-06", "readtime": "8.91", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "13 Ways To Growth Hack Using Viral Leaderboard ContestsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJul 9, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readSummary \u2014 Growth hacking is a hyped word. It is loosely defined as a generating growth from less effort by working smart and creative, not hard.We created a list of 13 innovative ways to leverage viral contest leaderboards will help you become an elite growth hacker. Each of these hacks will help you get more traffic, leads, sales and brand awareness.Contests, giveaways, sweepstakes and whatever else you can name them have become a key growth hacking acquisition strategy in a lot of online businesses. Customers are getting smarter and harder to market to. You\u2019ll need to innovate your marketing strategies in order to reach them, and the viral leaderboard contest can help.Do you need\u2026?More trafficMore leadsMore salesMore awarenessOf course you do! Keep reading to find out how viral contests do it.Basics of a contestRewarding someone for entering their information and completing an action (like referring a friend).A lot of contests are based on a points system. E.g. do X and get Y number of points. These points then rank the entrants in a leaderboard.The more tempting you make this offering the easier the acquisition of will be.Great offer + great audience = viral contest!So lets drive in and take a look at all the ways people are growth hacking their way to more leads, traffic and sales using viral leaderboard contests.1. Social follower contestEveryone knows that a large social following is almost a prerequisite for online business validation. We also know that the value of a Facebook follower is decreasing. So instead of paying thousands of dollars building your social following, you can launch a contest and ask users to follow your social media pages.By rewarding extra points for entrants to follow your page, you will have a large following in no time.TIP \u2014 Make sure what you are giving away is aligned with your business so that your entrants are focused to your niche. If you\u2019re giving away a $500 cash reward, the chances are you will get a pretty general following that probably doesn\u2019t care about your company. If you are in the golf niche and offer the latest golf clubs, chances are your entrants are going to be more targeted.2. Email lead contestEmails are a vital part to most business, it\u2019s a direct contact with your customer is always a great starting point no matter what you are selling (products, content or services). Using gamification in the form of a points system sparks the competitiveness in humans.This email collection contest is the easiest to execute on and it pretty much rewards entrants with more points every time they refer a new person to your contest. Awards are given to people with the most points.TIP \u2014 Giving multiple prizes helps to make your contest even more competitive. A lot of people don\u2019t think they can win 1st place if the winner is too far ahead, but if there are enough consolation prizes to make it interesting, they\u2019re more likely to participate.3. Joint venture contestMake your contest more interesting and valuable by introducing a complementary brand, product to partner. This will give you more to offer in terms of prizes as well as help in the promotion and marketing of your contest.TIP \u2014 Try using influencers to promote your contest. You are able to leverage their audience as well as use them as a validator that your contest is worth entering. People are much more likely to take a recommendation from a friend, family member, colleague or influencer than the brand itself!For example, one of our clients, Fatburger, teamed up with Wal Mart to do a joint giveaway, which lended the brand a lot of social validation.4. Waiting listWaiting is never fun but turn a negative into a positive with a waiting list contest. Promote a page that announces the release of XX (whatever people are waiting for) and have people sign up for the waiting list. Once they are signed up they can then see where they are in line!You can incentives people to move up the line by referring others to the list, get them to follow your social media or get them to complete custom actions like watch a video, join a Facebook group or complete a quiz!This is great for keeping your brand in the spotlight and building hype before your release or launch date.TIP \u2014 Make sure you send out a reminder close to when you are ready to open the doors to your waiting list to get them excited again. This is also a great time to reward everyone on the list with a gift (discount, free item, bonus content etc).5. Product launchSimilar to the contest above but more focused on the release of a product. Since this is a product it allows you to get a little more creative with your rewards. For example, if you were releasing a new product (e.g. a power bank) you could give the top 10 entrants a free power bank and anyone who reached 5000 pints 50% off!This incentivizes people to collect more points by sharing your contest, following your social accounts or completing custom actions you set!TIP \u2014 The better you make the grand prize the more people will want to share your contest to get points. We suggest running this about 30 days prior to your release date. Once you get to your release date you should have a huge list of emails to market to as well!6. Course launchThis one is pretty self-explanatory after the prior contest type. Use all the same principles but for your course. You can offer free course chapters, lifetime access or 1on1 training sessions as rewards in your launch contest.TIP \u2014 Try and run a few friends through your course first to get feedback and get some testimonials to use on the course launch page. This will validate the course and make the prize of wining more enticing.7. Evergreen funnelThis is one of people\u2019s favorite contest types as it is a constant stream of leads. A contest is set up to run constantly rewarding winners every week/month or quarter. The idea of this is to keep a constant steam of traffic running to this contest page to keep it alive. Here is an example of how we run an evergreen contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/199TIP \u2014 Add a link to your evergreen costed from a website popup/tab, Facebook page tab, Instagram bio, include it in your email prospecting drip and even in your paid acquisition.8. Product / Facebook Page ReviewsGetting positive product reviews is a fantastic way to improve your conversion rate. People love seeing validation on a product they are about to purchase. You can use a custom contest entry to incentivize a product review.TIP \u2014 It\u2019s best to do this only for people who have actually bought your product, otherwise it\u2019s unethical. You can make this more legitimate by making the custom entry question the receipt number of their purchase or their email they used at time of purchase.9. Survey/Quiz ContestGetting customers/browsers feedback can be tricky but we still do it as it is some of the most important information we can obtain to grow our business. Leverage contest to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing aLeverage contests to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing a Google form or completing a single answer question (see below), it will help them get closer to winning the contest and get you your much-needed data.TIP \u2014 The feedback can be on your website design, product, industry, information about them to help you build personas on the people who are interested in your brand. Also think about sweetening the deal by having a discount code at the end of the contest. This also drives a few sales as well ;)10. Crowd Sourcing (Kickstarter)Everyone seems to be crowed souring something these days, a trip around the world, a new business venture or new product. But how do you make yours stand out? The hardest part about crowed sourcing is getting eyeballs on your project.Use a contest to generate hype, drive traffic, collect emails and build audiences. You can award people who back your project, share it, watch your product video & more. The possibilities are endless.You can also run a contest before even launching your Kickstart so that when you launch you already have an email list to market to.TIP \u2014 Tier your contest rewards similar to ho you would for a Kickstarter. Once a contestant gets X amount of points they get Y. Also make sure you have some low entry rewards to keep people motivated. E.g. get 10% OFF when you reach 500 points.11. Social Proof Contest (get cheap likes, shares & comments)This is one of the most powerful but underutilized features of contests. The ability to incentivize someone to like, share and comment on a Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn post is worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars.Not only does this make your post look extremely popular but you can pin this to the top of your page so when people visit your page it looks like you have some serious engagement. Social engagement is like word of mouth, e.g. \u201cJack liked this so I should too\u201d.TIP \u2014 Use this tactic on your Facebook ads to get better quality scores and make your ads look more authoritative. A combination of leaderboard contest + lots of social validation + Facebook ads is a slam dunk for growth!12. Video engagement contest (YouTube & GB)YouTube is a huge opportunity that is extremely hard to break into, there are hundreds of minutes of video uploaded every 60 seconds so how do you make your videos stand above the rest? You game the algorithms by incentivizing comments, likes, and subscribers on your videos.Nothing moves you up the search results in YouTube faster than comment engagement so make sure you also reply to those comments as well to get some conversations started.TIP \u2014 In the custom entry of your leaderboard contest ask a question instead of just asking entrants to thumbs up your YouTube video. E.g. For 100 points, watch this YouTube video and ask 1 question in the comments\u201d. This will make the comments seem a little more organic!13. Create custom audiences for FacebookNot enough people use custom audiences on Facebook for hyper-targeted campaigns. Once you please a pixel on the contest landing page and thank you page your can start building an audience in Facebook. With this audience you can push specific offers to that targeted audience or create \u201clook-a-like\u201d audiences to find people similar to those who entered your contest.TIP \u2014 once your contest ends, run a Facebook campaign with the messaging. \u201cThanks for entering our contest, sorry you didn\u2019t win but we don\u2019t want you to miss out. So here is a 50% off coupon code that is valid for the next 48 hours\u201d. The ROI on this campaign will be through the roof!So by now, your brain should be buzzing with new ideas on how you can use VYPER\u2019s Leaderboard Contests to grow your business. We have seen time and time again engagement and share-ability take a campaign from 0\u2013100 very quickly.

It has been the most effective way for him to build and push users through the social followers -> email subscriber -> paying customer funnel.Why did you decide to run a contest? We love running contests and viral launch campaigns for our clients as a way of turning social media followers into email subscribers and eventually into paying customers.Problems you were facing? We\u2019d tried and tested running social traffic to landing pages, which were converting fine, but we wanted to amplify the social audiences, and found that viral competitions are a very effective way to do this.Growth needed? Clients would come to us asking us to grow their email lists by thousands of subscribers, and they wanted to achieve this at the lowest possible cost. This is quite a daunting task when there is little momentum or acquisition infrastructure in place.What expectations and goals did you have/set for your contest? We are generally aiming to get 3,000+ email subscribers from a viral contest of this nature and to send the subscribers and offer which will convert them into customers.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work? We have tried using Gleam.io & Matire App which are great tools in their own right, but found that conversion and virality were higher when using VYPER.Contest example results:Justin Bieber Tickets ContestEmails: 8,178+Social followers: 5,000+Customers: 100+ app downloadsSocial media mentions increased exponentially.Evil Energy ContestEmails: 6,594+Social followers: 3,000+Traffic increase: 1,000+ website clicks during contest periodWhat are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest? We\u2019ve setup and promoted a lot of these contests. Some work better than others.Viral contests are a great way to turn social media followers into email subscribers.Seeding contests with an existing email list can help a lot get you started.Not every contest you setup is going to be a sure-fire success.The more entries you get, the more viral the contest seems to go.Sending email blasts mid-competition is a great way to boost the viral effect and bump up entry numbers. The more entries you have, the bigger the effect of a follow up email will be.What would you do next time you ran a contest?Send big email blasts to pre-existing lists as soon as the contest launches.Drive traffic through mass tweeting at relevant people.Get as much PR and influencer shoutouts to the campaign as possible. PR has been a great way to get high quality leads.Ask for feedback on the contest page from customers & others before launching.Use the new custom entries tools to get more information from entrants.How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you? We\u2019ve promoted and cross-promoted contests on lots of different channels. We try to promote through as many channels as possible simultaneously to get the contest going.Once you get momentum the contest really starts to accelerate!What has worked the best:Email a solid pre-subscribed list (+Get others to email it out for you) \u2014 We\u2019ve found email to be a really good source of signups, especially if they\u2019re already on your list. Cold email generally gets much lower conversion rates than emailing a subscribed list.Twitter \u2014 We build networks of 10+ Twitter accounts, build nice followers and send tweets and DM\u2019s to the followers telling them about the contest.Instagram \u2014 We\u2019ve built niche accounts and DM the followers to tell them about the contest. It works ok, but if you start sending too much traffic from too many accounts via DM\u2019s the accounts can get shut down or suspended.LinkedIn \u2014 Building up networks of connections and telling them about the contest via direct message and published pulse blog posts.Paid traffic via Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. \u2014 We see an opportunity with viral contests to reduce CPA by sending ads to VYPER\u2019s contest landing pages, collecting Facebook pixels for retargeting all the people who land on the page (and those who sign up), and also trying to convert them with an opt-in bribe as soon as they sign up for the contest.Facebook Groups \u2014 We\u2019ve tried a lot of stuff with Facebook groups. Where we\u2019ve had most success is building relationships with the people who own the groups and getting them to post the link into the group as they already have authority there.PR \u2014 We\u2019ve also found that high quality PR can boost the number of high quality relevant signups.Competition directories \u2014 Quality of entrants drops from this source but it\u2019s a good way to get the word out to a lot of people quickly.About the Agency Digital Growth are an international Growth Agency focused on building social media audiences on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn & Instagram. They turn social media audiences into email subscribers & customers by creating and promoting viral contests and launch campaigns.Dan@digitalgrowthhackers.com http://www.digitalgrowthhackers.comOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How to Use Facebook Ads to Create an Optimal Email Lead Capture Campaign", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-use-facebook-ads-to-create-an-optimal-email-lead-capture-campaign-68de2c54320f?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-24", "readtime": "12.2", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "How to Use Facebook Ads to Create an Optimal Email Lead Capture CampaignVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJun 21, 2016 \u00b7 13 min readFor a lot of marketers, a lead capture campaign is a great way to get started with Facebook ads. Optimizing for purchase conversions can be very difficult at first, but a lead capture campaign is easier to set up and you can get much more value out of it right from the get go.Why do email lead capture campaigns work?You\u2019re going for a much easier conversion (getting their email address), so your advertising dollars don\u2019t go to waste trying to convert for purchases.It\u2019s much easier to setup, and there\u2019s not as much optimization required as you would need if you\u2019re trying to get purchase conversions.Once you have the leads, you can use the Facebook pixel cookie to retarget your customers, which is the #1 most profitable Facebook ads campaign you can run.Emails can be used to build up your audience even when you don\u2019t have a product to target them with. (Great for future product launches.)You offer some kind of valuable freebie that builds brand relationship with your target customer.What are the cons of an email lead capture campaign?You need a strong email marketing drip sequence to activate that customer to purchase.It\u2019s a 2-part conversion, so you need to have your funnel right, otherwise your ads will still be unprofitable.If you can get the purchase with your ads without lead capture, this brings in more direct revenue and it\u2019s easier to measure.Basically if you can get a profitable purchase campaign going, lead capture is a secondary campaign you can run alongside your purchase campaign, but it should be relegated to only a fraction of your budget at this point. (However, if you can\u2019t get a profitable purchase campaign, then the lead capture campaign is king).Let\u2019s get started.What you will learn:How to setup your offer (viral giveaway or lead magnet).How to set up your Facebook ecosystem (pixels, audiences and accounts).How to setup the best Facebook prospecting campaign to get your giveaway generating leads straight out of the gates (starting the snowball). The more momentum you can build the more emails you will generate from your giveaway.How to use Facebook remarketing ads to turn those new visitors into customers and start generating a ROI before your giveaway even ends.Setting up your offerOption 1: Viral Contest + Lead Magnet Combo using VYPERViral contest are like snowballs, once they start rolling they get bigger and bigger and become unstoppable customer acquisition machines!This helps make your lead-gen campaign 2x more profitable, as each lead you acquire via Facebook ads can turn into 1.5 leads on average.Haven\u2019t created a contest yet? Sign up for a VYPER account to immediately to kick start your viral marketing strategy.VYPER also has built in lead magnet delivery (or we call them opt-in bribes).Option 2: Alternatively, you can setup a solo lead magnet.Don\u2019t want to start a giveaway? Awwww.If you just want to offer a solo lead magnet, like a PDF or a coupon, you can do that with tools like Unbounce.This requires a bit of work as you\u2019ll need to design a lead magnet, create your landing page, etc. You can also use a tool like Beacon to create your lead magnets.We highly recommend doing a viral giveaway as it\u2019s pretty cheap/easy to setup and you\u2019re going to get the most signups from this.Basics: Setting up Facebook CorrectlyYou will need to start off with a few basics. The bare minimum you need is a Facebook personal account and a personal ad account BUT we highly suggest following the below steps for setting up your Facebook ecosystem properly by using a Facebook Business account.Below is a list of things you need to do right now:Login to your personal Facebook profile, pretty much everyone has one of these.Get a Facebook business account to get your sh*t organized, create a business account, a few benefits to this type of account is:Add multiple users,Manage multiple ad accounts,Manage multiple Facebook pages,Create multiple Pixels (you can also share these with other accounts as there is 1 pixel ID per ad account)Create product catalogs (used for dynamic product ads)Better Audiences and insights controlHere is an overview of the Facebook business account if you need more convincingCreate a Facebook ad account which is super easy to add within your new Facebook business account manager. You can also easily add your billing information to your ad account once it is set up. Facebook restricts your ad spend to start with and you have to work your way up from a $25 credit limit. They trust NO ONE!If you run into trouble with any of this set up, Facebook has a great support portal that not too many people know about this portal, so the response times are good. You can contact Facebook reps through live chat or email.IMPORTANT: Using pixelsThe reason why Facebook is such a great marketing channel is the use of their Pixels and being able to optimize ads to a specific goal (Pixel \u2014 ie. the signup success page of our giveaway).WTF is a pixel? \u2014 it is a snippet of code that is added to a website page that collects information on the users that views/visits the page. This information is then sent back to Facebook so you can build audiences, track conversions and create look-a-like audiences.Using pixels in your marketing mix is important because we can set ads to optimize to these pixels. Again, in a nutshell, this tells Facebook who to serve our ads to and target people who are most likely to achieve our goal and convert (i.e. get to our signup success page of our giveaway).Pixel breakdown:Below we will go into how to add pixels to our giveaway so don\u2019t worry if this is sounding complicated at the moment, it is super easy!Overview: Facebook Ads ExplainedYou will want to either use the Facebook Ads Manager (basic) or the Facebook Power Editor (advanced) to set up your ads, these are the two different methods for launching ads on Facebook.Power Editor ProsSearch functionality for ads and bulk editingNo BS when setting up adsAdding UTM tags and pixels is easySetting up dynamic product adsCreating canvas adsPower Editor ConsVery hard to gauge ad performance and metricsHorrible for optimizing adsYou kind of have to know what you are doing to use this platformEasy to make mistakesAd Manager ProsEasy UX and definitely a smaller learning curveMuch better metric and optimization selectionFiltering data functions are awesome (age, demo, placement etc.)Very visual for ad creation and steps users through the setupAd Manager ConsSlows down your computer a lot when trying to do too much at onceLoads data slowlyHaving to make bulk edits is hardSo now you should know if you need to use Power Editor or Ads Manager, a lot of people get these two confused. They do the exact same thing (create ads) but just in different ways. I do suggest using power editor to create ads then ads manager to optimize ads.Choosing your ad type:Click ads \u2014 this ad is for 1200x628 size images, there is plenty of space to visually show a CTA on one side of the image and a lifestyle or product on the other. This is one of the most common ad types.Carousel ads \u2014 these ads are a lot more creative, they are usually have the advantage of being able to relay more information to web users as these ads have multiple images, headlines and descriptions.Canvas ads \u2014 this is a relatively new one and helps you create a \u201cmicro landing page\u201d within the Facebook platform. This can be a great way to educate your leads before sending them to your actual website.Creating Your Contest Ad CampaignsWe\u2019re assuming that you took our advice and decided to make a contest for your lead capture campaign. GREAT! If you didn\u2019t and you decided to use a lead magnet, that\u2019s fine as well, but replace the words \u201cgiveaway\u201d or \u201ccontest\u201d with \u201clead magnet.\u201dOnward\u2026We are going to go over 2 campaigns that you need to set up when running your giveaway. The first is to capture the interest of people who will be most likely to enter your giveaway and the second is to re-engage those who have entered your giveaway or shown interest in it.1. The Contest PostWe need get our contest out there and seen by the world. So the best way to do that is to create a high quality ad that has a good Click Through Rate (CTR) and is optimized to the (lead) pixel we are going to place on the contest entered success page.Quick guide on how to set these pixels up in VYPER (note, you must have the PRO account for tracking pixels to be allowed).Create/login to your Facebook Ad accountAdd the Facebook pixels to your contest page. This can be done on the settings step when creating your giveaway. We are placing the \u201cPageView\u201d (all pages) and \u201cLead\u201d (thank you page) pixel. NOTE \u2014 if you are already using the pageview pixel simply rename the pixel. Change \u201cfbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cPageView\u201d); to fbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cContestPage\u201d);.Create your Ad. We are using the carousel ad to show off all the products that we are giving away. The CTR is usually better on these ads as you can provide more information before paying Facebook for the click through to your contest page. Meaning you can validate the user/click better.Create a list of your competitors. This will help target people who are already interested in what you sell (product or information). E.g. We ran a giveaway for HumbleBody.com (hemp based skincare products) so we collected a list of other organic skin care brands.Create your campaign, I use the following naming convention to keep my campaigns descriptive and organized \u2014 \u201cleads / contest / competitors\u201d. This helps define our campaign \u201cconversion goal / content type / targeting type\u201d and I also use the UTM builder and the camping name to see the traffic in Google Analytics. Below is an example of the link that I would use in my ads.Source = facebookMedium = cpcCampaign = leads / contest / competitorsCreate your ad sets, I usually break these out into the interest group or placement. For Humble Body we create 6 ad sets making the interest different in each ad set.Decl\u00e9orOlivellaJuaraTata Harper Skin Care\u2026\u2026.. and a few othersFor the bidding strategy set a lifetime budget and automatically optimized to your offsite conversion pixel (Lead). A lifetime budget is easier to manage and Facebook\u2019s optimization algorithms are not forced to spend your full daily budget which prevents you from wasting money! Once you have run a few campaigns you can then switch to daily budgets.Now you are ready to launch your ad campaign. Make sure your ads are set to run only while the giveaway is accepting entries so set the ad end date 1 day before your giveaway end date.2. The Contest Remarketing CampaignNow that you know that people want your product (they visited your contest page) you can set up some remarketing ads to engage these people again. Returning visitors are 7x times more likely to complete a conversion goal than a first time visitor.Quick guide on how to set these up:Create your custom audience from the PageView pixel we placed above. I usually break out my audiences into 10 or 15 day increments from when someone visited. So my audience naming convention would be \u2014 PageView (15), PageView (30) and PageView (180).Go to your audience page in Facebook manager and choose create audience. You can find this page from the mega dropdown, click on the \u201caudience\u201d menu item.Create a new audience using the website traffic tab. These are the best audiences to create as they automatically update as more people visit the page unlike uploaded lists that need to be constantly uploaded to stay relevant and up to date.Create a custom combination audience. Using custom combinations allows you to include and exclude certain traffic so this can be a very powerful tool.Choose the event for traffic conditions. We use the event instead of the URL as this is a more accurate method of collecting data on our website visitors.Select the pixel \u201cPageView\u201d if you want the audience to be even more targeted you can choose the \u201cLead\u201d pixel that we placed above, this smaller audience will serve ads to the people who have opted-into your giveaway.Create your campaign I use the name \u201cretargeting / contest visitors / female\u201d. I like to create a male and female campaign so I can optimize by gender. This means pausing ads and ad sets that are not performing well (CPA or CTR too high).Create your ad sets, I usually break these out into the time periods mentioned above so for example \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / mobile\u201d and \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / desktop\u201dCreate an ad that has a special value proposition for people who have already visited your contest or page. For example we offered a 10% discount for our remarketing campaign. E.g. Still looking for that perfect \u201cxxxx\u201d, come back and get 10% off your first order with the coupon code \u201cxxxx\u201d.Once you have created the Audiences and ads you are ready to go live and start making some money!So there you have it, the killer combination of Facebook ads and giveaways. This tactic works for bringing in new visitors to your website through the incentive of the giveaway as well as recapture those visitors with an incentivised remarketing ad.With this tactic you can collect emails and generate sales from new prospects.Tips for FacebookWhen creating your ads test 3\u20134 images and text variations to see which ad combinations get the best conversion and clickthrough rates. You can then pause the ads that are not performing well to save some cash.Aim to have an audiences that has at least 1000+ people in it as the minimum Facebook daily budget is $5/day. You want your audiences to be target but still have enough people in them so that your ads run at a reasonable frequency (e.g. we do not want 1 person to see our ad 10 times in a day).Optimize your ads to the Facebook pixels. Facebook do a pretty good job at automatically optimizing your ads for the best ROI. It is worth setting some benchmarks though as you can\u2019t simply do whatever Facebook says. See how much your are paying for the below are compare to industry benchmarks:Lead (aim for $1\u20134 for a basic email sign up)Click through (aim for a CTR above 0.5%)Cost per click (aim for a CPC under $3)Note that all of these metrics will depend on the type of industry and niche you are in.Pause ads that have no conversions (Leads) and a high spend. This is why we separate out the interest groups, gender and days since a visitor hit your website. You will probably find your product is best suited to a certain gender, interest and that the 0\u201315 day period since visiting your website perform better than others.BONUS \u2014 If you want to utilize your Facebook pixels for more than just your giveaway check out some of the options below how on to install the pixels across your entire website.Here is the Facebook guide to setting up pixels on your website, if this is a little too much we suggest using a plugin within your CMS.Essentially you need to place the \u201cPageView\u201d pixel in the header template of your website, you will need the Facebook Chrome browser extension to see if the pixel is firing correctly.Here are guides to adding pixels to the most popular CMS\u2019s:Wordpress (setup guide)ShopfyMagentoThe pixels I like to add to my website are:PageView (we can also create custom pixels for contest pages)Lead (used for giveaways, email capture tools etc.)AddToCart (used for abandoned cart)InitiateCheckout (used for abandon checkout)Purchase (make sure you have dynamic checkout values on this pixel)The first two were the pixels we used in our giveaway settings.If you have any questions about this strategy please leave a comment below are I will personally answer it for you!

But apart from the main objective, we had an alternative objective \u2014 to increase social interaction. This giveaway enabled us to target both the concerns in one go.About The BrandPhotoWhoa helps Photographers discover awesome, innovative, and informative photography products at discount prices. It brings the best industry products from world famous photographers and photography brands at a discounted price.Moreover, the Photowhoa blog helps budding photographers draw inspiration from expert photographers through interviews or one on one conversations.The PrizeDeciding on the price was majorly influenced by photography as that is target audience. We decided to offer three winners a set of our best products. The total value of the prize was more than $2000.With VYPER the entire process was very easy. There was a huge list of prizes that were being offered and to present it was a challenge but with VYPER\u2019s it was simple to present all the prizes in an enticing manner using their editor.The Promotional StrategyThe major promotions we did was through our social media channels and our already-existing email list as the target was referral participants. Also, we submitted the giveaway to few sweepstakes and giveaway sites as well.Sending the giveaway to our existing email list may sound counterintuitive, but we were sure that we\u2019d get a fair amount of referral traffic. We knew they would want to enter themselves and will post the contest on their own social media channels to get entries. They\u2019d also share the contest with their friends through email as they\u2019d want more referral points.Key TakeawayMake sure you include a lot of information in your giveaway landing page.Promote your giveaway to your own list first as these people probably know similar people who would be in your target audience.Aim for a high value prize pools, PhotoOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Benji Hyam: 30k Monthly Visitors from Content Marketing", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/benji-hyam-30k-monthly-visitors-from-content-marketing-b6f8344418f0?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-09-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-24", "readtime": "16.8", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Benji Hyam: 30k Monthly Visitors from Content MarketingVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 21, 2016 \u00b7 17 min readIntro:Benji Hyam is an expert at content marketing and runs a website called growandconvert.com which focuses on teaching people how to properly do content marketing and measure its impact with key metrics that actually move the needle in revenue or customer acquisition.Key Topics:There is a gap in the market for people providing good content for content marketingThe importance of using content upgradesThe marketing tactics Benji uses when releasing a new blog postsChoosing a lead magnet for your content upgradeUsing surveys in your marketing strategyDownload the cheat sheet and key takeaways from the Q&A session HEREQ&A Session Transcript Between Jack & BenjiINTERVIEWER: Thanks for taking time Benji. Awesome that you could pencil out some time in the day from Grow & Convert, have been an avid reader for a while.Just wanted to go through a few questions with you today about content marketing.BENJI: Cool. Fire away.INTERVIEWER: So our first question is, tell us a little bit about your business, who are is your audiences and how you\u2019ve gone about leveraging content marketing for this?BENJI: It actually started while I was still working full time for another company. I was running marketing for a start up in San Francisco.I met my partner Devesh at a marketing dinner held in San Francisco run by Sujan Patel.I had just left Thinkapps, which was another startup that I\u2019d worked for in San Francisco. I\u2019d built out an entire content marketing program for them and grew it from zero to 35,000 unique visitors a month and it was driving almost all the revenue for the business.So it started with Devesh and I talking about this problem and then figuring out that there is a lot of marketing blogs out there but no one that\u2019s really teaching this with really in-depth case studies and learning material.So that was the angle that we wanted to focus on, really helping educate the market on content marketing.INTERVIEWER: So you\u2019re finding that there\u2019s a gap in quality content available to people for learning content marketing.Your website helps people ranging from solo entrepreneurs to large companies that need direction and education of how to turn content marketing into measurable results.BENJI: For sure. Yeah that\u2019s definitely simplified, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.INTERVIEWER: Well after reading your blog post, you guys are publishing some pretty awesome stuff.BENJI: Thanks. So basically we have Grow and Convert for education and then we came out with a SAAS product. Like I said one of the challenges for marketers inside of companies is scaling content.So it\u2019s usually hiring writers, a lot of people starting out they\u2019re doing all the writing for their companies or they\u2019re getting the founders to do a lot of writing and so once it goes past that level, like founders can\u2019t be writing all the content forever.It\u2019s good to get the content off the ground but then you need the process to scale.One of the things that I\u2019d noticed being a content marketing manager and managing content for a few different companies was actually getting\u2026you take all this time creating content and getting content and then when you actually have to go get it into Wordpress, it\u2019s a huge pain.A lot of people are using Google Docs for guest posts, to write their own content because not a lot of people like writing in the Wordpress interface, formatting it and pulling all the text and images and headings from Google Docs takes an hour or two for each post.So we created a SaaS app called Postable.io which basically takes a blog post from Google Docs and places it in Wordpress in 15 seconds fully formatted, so it saves hours of time from formatting blog posts each month.INTERVIEWER: Yeah that\u2019s a huge thing because I think Google Docs is so much easier for sharing, reviewing and all that sort of stuff.If you\u2019ve got a guest blogger, you don\u2019t necessarily want to make them an admin of your Wordpress\u2026BENJI: Exactly, so even the security thing too, it\u2019s like consistency, getting a bunch of people in your back end is something people are already somewhat uncomfortable with.Also the consistency if you have a specific tone or writing style or way that you format the blog post, getting a bunch of different contributors all using their own styles is difficult, and so having one person to manage the content and having this process only take 15 seconds to a minute depending on how many images you have.It just saves everyone a bunch of time.INTERVIEWER: Question number two would be \u2014 from your past experience what sort of lead generation and lead bait content have been the most successful with content upgrades?For example out of ebooks, downloads, guides and checklists. What have you found to be the most successful in generating leads?BENJI: So I\u2019ve tested all of them throughout the career so I can tell you for Grow and Convert we\u2019ve tested a lot of things from spreadsheets to calculators to PDFs of our posts.The most successful thing that we have is actually a spreadsheet for Medium.I wrote an article about how I leveraged Medium to drive 10,000 visitors in four days, and a big part of the process in the post was using Medium publications.So these Medium publications have their own audience and basically their own email newsletter list and so just like any blog, going after a blog with a large audience, going after a Medium publication with a large audience will help you get visibility.So what I did is I create a spreadsheet that took 2\u20133 hours that listed all the Medium publications by traffic and then write descriptions about the topics that each one covered.The benefit to the end user was if you\u2019re going to follow my process for getting attraction on Medium, this was a big piece of it was finding the right publication for your content and pitching it to them. This made it really simple for readers.I think we have something between 8\u201312% conversion rate from visitor to conversion for that content upgrade.INTERVIEWER: That\u2019s really good for a blog post.BENJI: Yeah, really really high compared to anything else. I think the average for our other stuff is somewhere 3\u20134%.So it\u2019s pretty much double if not triple, and it depends on the source too that the traffic comes from. When someone\u2019s finding it through SEO we\u2019re seeing double the conversion rate again.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, so it\u2019s definitely worth putting in the time to make a really valuable content upgrade as it will pay off for months if not years!BENJI: A hundred percent, and so I like to contrast that, we\u2019ve done things such as PDFs or just like really bite-sized take-aways from our posts.Some of it we\u2019ve gotten feedback that the content upgrade isn\u2019t that valuable so we\u2019ve gone and changed some of those things, that was really early when we just didn\u2019t put that much value and time into upgrades\u2026Now we\u2019ve really started to put as much time into content upgrade almost as we do the posts, like creating calculators, template models or added blog content.Basically anything on top of a strategy that we outline in our post that we think would be helpful for someone to actually implement for their company.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we\u2019ve actually had a bit of success creating guides, checklists and things in Google Docs and using that link as the content upgrade so people can do what they want with it.Add it to their drive, download It etc. but it also gives us the flexibility to change it at any point if we need to. So that also helps.BENJI: I think it\u2019s all a function of time.I think there\u2019s a lot of ways that you can add value and build your list using content upgrade.So again, I think it all comes down to how much time you spend on it. I think if you do put in the extra effort the content upgrade that do the best are the things that other people aren\u2019t creating like ling form ebooks.A lot of people aren\u2019t creating ebooks; calculators or models, so it\u2019s unique and we found that a lot of our people are downloading those as they have so much value.INTERVIEWER: And is that sort of like a development resource that you need to build out those calculators?BENJI: No, it\u2019s actually in Excel using formulas. So some of the stuff we do use freelancers like we\u2019ve gotten on Upwork, but most of it we can do all of it our self if it\u2019s simple spreadsheet or anything like that.INTERVIEWER: What\u2019s a blog post that you\u2019ve written, just as a reference, for a really good content upgrade?One includes a calculator and one that includes your top converting content upgrade? Just people can go and look it up.BENJI: Yes, so it\u2019s going viral, I got 10,000 views of Medium in four days, so that was the one I was referencing the blog post.In terms of the calculator, we just recently did a post on lead nurturing versus direct conversions to help people figure out is it better to offer a content upgrade, or is it better to actually go for a direct lead.Some businesses it \u2018s better to grow an email list and others it\u2019s better to go directly to a sales call, let\u2019s say if you\u2019re an agency or something like that, it might not make sense for you to build your list.It might make sense for you to go directly to a sales conversation even though the numbers are lower, and so this calculator helps you decide, based on your traffic metrics and your conversion metrics, which is better for your business.We have also done a post on a growth model for your blog and that also has a calculator content upgrade.(Editor\u2019s note: We created our own tool that makes content upgrades super easy! Try it today!)INTERVIEWER: I was reading through your website and one of the blog posts that was very interesting is that you\u2019ve used surveys to drive leads.Obviously this is more of a nurture approach as opposed to direct response.What\u2019s the strategy you\u2019ve used to integrate surveys and what sort of tools do you use to implement that strategy?BENJI: Yes, so there\u2019s two ways that we\u2019ve been using surveys.This actually stems from my background, start-up marketing, I mean for growth marketing, like early stage startups this is a big key.It\u2019s just really understanding your users in-depth, so we\u2019ve been using it in two ways.One \u2014 to help us figure out what type of content is most valuable to our customers;Two \u2014 when we launched Postable surveying our users to figure out what features are valuable, what part of the product do they think is most valuable, help us improve and iterate on our product.I guess because this is more focused on content I can walk through some ways that we\u2019re using surveying.So in our welcome email we ask the question:\u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019re currently facing in marketing?\u201dAnd we ask them to tell us a little bit about themselves, the reason we\u2019re doing that is to really target marketers inside of companies, and so part of that relates to our content strategy.We want to attract the people that we think are going to purchase from us down the road, and so by asking who these people are we\u2019re able to kind of measure over time how many of these people we\u2019re actually attracting that fit within the bucket that we\u2019re trying to go after.And too asking them their biggest challenge, we\u2019re getting a lot of data from our audience about what some of the most challenging things for them are.So these inform blog post ideas which then again go attract more people like these people back to our blog.So that\u2019s probably the biggest survey benefits, it\u2019s like a simple thing that we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not anything complicated.It\u2019s just when someone subscribes we ask them this simple question. And it\u2019s something that not a lot of people do on their blog and it feels very personal.We also identify compliments from people and we can actually respond to every single person trying to give them some advice or just pointing them in the right direction with a piece of content we\u2019ve already written.So it\u2019s just going a little above and beyond and forming that relationship with our customers early on.We\u2019ve found it actually helps us in our sales process too just because we\u2019ve already had conversations with hundreds and hundreds of people. So yeah, that\u2019s a big surveying thing that we do.In terms of launching products, we launch a mini course to kind of validate the concept before actually creating a larger course.So a big aha moment for us was we through this user-research, because I come from the start-up world is very\u2026I guess \u2018abnormal\u2019 for people that are marketers to implement before they ever do the content strategy.Through surveying we realized that this was a common misstep. And this is like the most important step that anyone needs to have to be able to create a content strategy that can actually scale a blog.So even from when we\u2019re creating our product the surveying really helped us uncover some of those key pains that people were facing, and if we\u2019d launched our product without that section.I don\u2019t think people would have actually been as successful coming out of the program if we didn\u2019t survey them, we would have completely missed that step and told people to go directly to content strategy without knowing their customers.Some tools that we use, Survey Monkey, just keep it simple, it\u2019s free and you can create a free 10-question survey.So we actually showed people our process for sending out the survey to people, what the results were and then how to transform the results into actionable ideas for a business whether it\u2019s content strategy or blog posts.INTERVIEWER: So do funnel people on the click to subscribe and then send them to a survey? Say I\u2019m a user, I click to subscribe, fill out your survey, do you then segment lists based on those results or what do you segment?BENJI: So that\u2019s one of the questions I always get. The first few questions in the survey is just, who are you?We wanted to segment users versus core audience, marketers inside of companies versus solo entrepreneurs.There are some people that are outside the marketing industry, and in order not to taint the data and to paint the picture in a different way we try and funnel those out in the first questions so that we could segment our core audience.We wanted to know what those people really cared about versus people who are on our blog who are still engaged but maybe weren\u2019t in our core target audience.INTERVIEWER: Okay. So from that Survey Monkey form, does that import into your ESP (email service provider) or are you manually doing that?BENJI: Yeah we\u2019re manually doing that, we export to Excel.It doesn\u2019t go directly into our email service provider; we weren\u2019t using it to try to get a persona of people as we do not want to tie revenue or anything like that to the person.It\u2019s just for us to get a better understanding overall of who is reading our blog and what they\u2019re there for and what their challenges are. So we do not segment our email drips at the moment.INTERVIEWER: Yeah it\u2019s a huge step that a lot of people miss I think just because it does seem daunting trying to set that up. Once you just get your hands dirty it\u2019s probably worth it in the long run as you\u2019re showing us.BENJI: Yep.INTERVIEWER: The next question. You obviously rely a lot of SEO coming in the content marketing space, what other traffic sources do you see high conversion rates from? Now obviously quality of traffic is very important.BENJI: Yes. So we sort of uncovered a few things that we weren\u2019t aware of. One piece of our promotion strategy is a community content promotion strategy.The meaning behind the community content promotion is someone\u2019s already done a lot of the work to develop an audience similar to yours.For us there are tons of other marketing blogs and groups that contain marketers. Especially when you\u2019re starting off it\u2019s very difficult for you to go build your own massive community around a subject so just use someone else\u2019s.Someone\u2019s likely already done the work for you, and so the constant promotion strategy that we follow is doing the research around what other groups already exist.Or what other websites already exist out there that have the same audience, and then thinking through how we can go form a relationships with those people.Write about those companies so that they will want to share it with their audience or become active in these groups.Some of the high traffic drivers for us have been being involved with the GrowthHackers community, getting in the Inbound.org forum, writing guest blog posts.That actually all stemmed from a presentation that I saw about Keaton Shaw two years ago in San Francisco.He was the one that opened my eyes to the whole surveying process and how to do it and then through testing it on different startups, I honed in on a specific way to do it.A big piece of content marketing success came when I saw his presentation and mentioned him in my case study, I reached out to Keaton and said \u201cHey I wrote this blog post about surveying and a lot of it came from your presentation.He actually shared that in his newsletter which blew up to like 4,000 plus people, and then that really expanded our audience marketers in the start-up community in the VC world and founders etc.Again there are tons of marketing Facebook groups out there, but there\u2019s also the strategy of just finding people that have a similar audience and forming some sort of relationship with them.That\u2019s a big driver of traffic, it\u2019s actually ahead of SEO for us.And then the other one is providing quotes or contributing to content like this, so getting guest blog posts that are driving traffic from similar sites to sites in our same space back to our site, so getting links which also helps with SEO as well.INTERVIEWER: So that\u2019s like connecting and partnering with influencers in your industry.BENJI: Correct. Yes.So, just a lot of marketing blogs will contribute a portion of the post with a link back to our site and so it helps position us as an authority in the space.It helps drive traffic, so people found us through a lot of other marketing blogs out there.This was something that got revealed using our survey that we weren\u2019t super aware of, just how much this was actually helping our growth.Even the relationships, the people who are communicating back and forth with us, a lot of those people had come from other sites.INTERVIEWER: Okay so it comes back to the quality again, you\u2019ve got more validation than just your own from other blogs which makes content a lot more compelling and authoritative.INTERVIEWER: What\u2019s the typical launch strategy after you finished creating your blog post?BENJI: So I would say I don\u2019t use any tools, I think the myth that most people think is there\u2019s all these tools that can help you do this.I think a lot of the strategy comes down to what I was talking about earlier, the community content-promotion standpoint.So a primary promotion channel are these general marketing groups, there\u2019s groups that almost all of our posts will fit that we can share. there\u2019s a list of influencers that all of our posts would be a good fit for them to share.So there\u2019s this general concept of marketing overall which is primary, and then secondary is specific to one of the posts that we wrote.So for example I wrote a post about why marketing has become the hardest position to hire for.Again it fits in that primary bucket of it\u2019s a post about marketing but then the secondary category is actually hiring, and so if you think about the audience it\u2019s a little bit different. So you have general marketers who are interested this post, but then the secondary channel is recruiters, and so how does this even help us get in front of the audience that we\u2019re going after because maybe that there\u2019s marketing recruiters who now see this post and it helps them make the point to their client that marketing is actually hard to hire for so hire us; some recruiters might be interested in this post.So when it comes down to promoting it I\u2019m thinking okay let\u2019s find a bunch of recruiting groups or hiring groups.So it\u2019s thinking about each specific post in this really specific framing, and so we do this with every post.It\u2019s like the general go-to places but then there\u2019s also different influencers, different groups.Maybe some different people that would find this interesting and so there\u2019s this research process that we do for every single one of these posts like who are the influencers that are talking about hiring for marketing?What are the groups around hiring or recruiting or sites that talk about this and pitching our posts to them.There is a whole separate checklist that we do for every single post which is posting the key areas and then go find these other areas that are specific to the post and go after those, and use some of the same strategies but it expands our reach a lot and it brings a lot of other people who maybe typically wouldn\u2019t have come to our blog to read our content, to our blog and it expands our reach a lot.INTERVIEWER: How much time did it take you to build up that authority in those groups?Obviously you can\u2019t just go in and start posting your links saying \u201cRead my blog post.\u201dWhat sort of time frames do you think is adequate enough before you can start doing more salesy posts (your own posts)?BENJI: Yeah, it really depends on the group.I think you bring up a good point, I think a lot of people just say go join a group and go drop a link in there.It\u2019s not going to be easy for you because people are going to flag you and they\u2019re going to get upset, they\u2019re going to say like you\u2019re just here to promote your own content.There\u2019s a lot of time involved, it\u2019s really like being a genuine active member in the community, helping people when they have questions and then also sharing your own content when you think it\u2019s valuable.When you\u2019re posting two or three or four times a month every single week, it\u2019s too much for these groups.You also can\u2019t post in all the same groups, you have to time it, so like maybe one post a month and maybe you contribute in some other way in some other way in the meantime and you go find other groups or other promotion channels, and then maybe you come back to the same post two months down the line and re-promote it.I don\u2019t think content promotion is ever dead, I think a lot of people put the focus on the first week or two and then kind of forget about it, but it\u2019s like an ongoing cycle where it\u2019s like you have to keep re-promoting these things and figuring out new channels, and so that will continue to drive growth overall.But I think, going back to your original question, I think the key thing is being real and I think being genuine contributors in this community is really what\u2019s going to help you be successful using the strategy.INTERVIEWER: Yeah for sure.And do you see more success using that groups approach or when you\u2019re promoting your new post on all of your internal channels like Facebook, Twitter, infographics with Pinterest or anything?Do you see more traffic from your current following or from those groups?BENJI: I think it changes as a business just like when you\u2019re first starting a blog.Social channels, referral channels are probably going to be your biggest source of traffic.Over time SEO starts taking over more and more, and the longer you\u2019re around probably the more SEO contributes to your blog traffic. I think it\u2019s the same here.So the goal is in the beginning to use some of these different promotion strategies to continue to build your own email list and to build your brand recognition and to build your following.We first started out and no one knew who Grow and Convert was, now the biggest organic traffic driver is branded search keywords which helps us a lot because it means that people are starting to recognize the brand.They\u2019re not only searching for long tailed keywords that are bringing them to a specific post, they\u2019re starting to recognize the brand overall.So I think the goal is to use some of these promotion channels early on, continue to build your brand and hopefully over time you\u2019ll have enough of an audience, enough of an email list where your internal channels will drive a lot more traffic.Than you can spend your time just creating better and better content and continuing to grow your internal list.But yeah, it\u2019s kind of a chicken-and-egg thing, you have to do this first.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a combination of everything, you can\u2019t just do one channel.BENJI: Exactly.Download the cheat sheet and key takeaways from the Q&A session HEREOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Vyper Coding Language to Take On Solidity \u2014 More Secure Smart Contracts?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/vyper-coding-language-to-take-on-solidity-more-secure-smart-contracts-ffd6b6bd1905?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-07-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vyper Coding Language to Take On Solidity \u2014 More Secure Smart Contracts?John SaddingtonFollowJul 11, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readVyper is going to disrupt Solidity\u2026 or, will it?Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vyper", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Cryptocurrency", "Altcoins"]}, {"title": "Case Study: Motobilt Added 4,290 Emails in 15 Days", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-motobilt-added-4-290-emails-in-15-days-7ce94f544064?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-02", "readtime": "1.43", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Case Study: Motobilt Added 4,290 Emails in 15 DaysVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 15, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readMotobilt is a company that sells custom fabrication parts, tools, builder parts, for off-road vehicles, hot rods, rat rods, and more.

One of the main ones being the Snapchat duplicate \u201cInstagram Stories\u201d which has surpassed Snap usage.This feature within Instagram has allowed brands to deliver more interesting and up to date content.Like all \u201corganic\u201d social media, there are some catches. Your content does not get seen by everyone and you need to follow the below guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of this channel.On a daily basis, more than 300 million users can be found on Instagram\u2019s Stories feature, which begs the question, if your business isn\u2019t using it, why not? According to the Instagram blog, users spend on average at least 24 minutes a day on the site.Need more convincing? How about this little factoid from Instagram? One out of five stories gets a direct message.That\u2019s a pretty solid reason to consider upping your Instagram game by using this feature.In this post, we\u2019re going to look at how you can use Stories to effectively boost interaction and sales.This infographic goes into more detail about how some of the world\u2019s leading brands have put this feature to use.Source Katka PavlickovaWhat Is the Instagram Stories Feature?It\u2019s pretty simple. You post a short video to your feed. The video can be about whatever you like \u2014 you can even shoot it directly off your phone, straight from the Instagram app. You\u2019ve got fifteen seconds, so make it count.All you need to do is to tap the camera icon while the app is open and then choose the type of content.You can choose between:Live: This allows you to post as you\u2019re filming. People can comment while you\u2019re busy broadcasting, and you\u2019ll have the option to post it to Stories when you\u2019re done. This is a good option if you know what you\u2019re going to say and that you can control the environment you\u2019re shooting in.Normal: Here you\u2019ll choose \u2014 one tap and you take a photo, holding it down will allow you to film a video.Boomerang: Not sure what to film but have a good GIF to share? Boomerang mode creates GIFs that loop for up to three seconds.Superzoom: This feature is a lens that keeps zooming closer to the subject. It\u2019s good for a big reveal. Have fun with this by adding an awesome soundtrack as well.Rewind: This is more of a fun lens as the video gets filmed in reverse, but it can also make for a change if you\u2019ve been posting the same thing over and over again.Stop Motion: This is great for a bunch of product shots. Stop Motion creates a video out of still shots. So instead of people having to click through to the next photo, this lens creates a slideshow, as it were.Hands Free: Not everyone wants to shoot immediately when they pick up the phone. Maybe you want to position it differently, or focus on another area. Just make sure that you have something you can rest your phone on so the picture will remain in focus and the phone won\u2019t shake. When you\u2019re ready to shoot, say, \u201cAction.\u201dAnd\u2026 We are sure that Instagram will be adding more options as well.Then just shoot your video and post. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to add a description, location, stickers, etc., before the post goes live.That\u2019s all there is to it. The post will stay live on the site for 24 hours and then happily move off into internet oblivion never to be seen again. Which is a big advantage when you want to build a loyal following, or when you want to test out new ideas.What About Hashtags?You should be using hashtags \u2014 sparingly. Make sure they\u2019re as relevant as possible to your content and limit the number of hashtags you use. How many is best?Here\u2019s a quick clue: the answer is not as many as possible. You can add up to thirty in total, but according to Statista, between two and five is the magic number.They got this figure from a study based on 200,000 Facebook posts, which while not the same channel, still provides a good indication of what to expect from Insta.Think of it this way, every extra hashtag you add decreases the likelihood of engagement from users interacting with the post.Stickers Aren\u2019t for Business, Surely?Oh, but they are. Stickers are a fun way to help your video stand out from the rest. Even if it\u2019s something as simple as a smile sticker, it adds an extra element of fun to your video.This channel is not all about serious business posts, so take advantage of that.There are tons to choose from \u2014 you can add a special holiday sticker, or even just a day of the week sticker. Have fun with this one, and your followers will as well.Set the LocationYou can use a sticker that shows your location. This is useful because people looking for Stories relating to the particular area will be able to see a group of posts about the location.Your post could be among them, and it\u2019s a great way to drive local traffic to your door.Want Quick Engagement?Why not set up a poll? This is an excellent way to get your followers involved and to discover if people really are interacting with your content.Use the Poll sticker and choose your questions carefully. Ideally, you want answers to be outside the standard yes or no response.Allow the Sharing of StoriesThis one may seem self-evident, but if you want better engagement than just people liking your posts, you\u2019ll need to go to your Story Settings and enable sharing.That way, people can send your story via direct message.You\u2019ll get extra views without even trying.Consider Adding Some WritingThis can be easily done to add some text to the video. All you need to do is to hit the Pen icon on the screen once you\u2019ve finished filming.This could be a great way to add content to your website, like a list of ingredients, etc.Find a Related Instagram AccountWhy not share the love with another Instagrammer? Tagging them before posting means that they get a shout out, and hopefully, they\u2019ll return the favor at a later stage.This is also a simple way to make sure that someone you want to shout out to knows you\u2019ve done it. They\u2019ll get a notification on their feed.Check on Who Has Watched Your StoryIf you click on the \u201cYour Story\u201d button on the home screen, all you have to do is to swipe up to see who has viewed the content.It\u2019s a good idea to do this from time to time, and to check out those accounts as well, so that you can keep track of who your main audience is.Keep an eye out for repeat visitors as this can be a good way to tell that you\u2019re posting content that people like. After all, if they didn\u2019t like it, they would hardly keep coming back, would they?This is also a way to keep track of which Stories worked out to be the most popular.Take the Time to Center Stickers and TextThe center of your screen is prime real estate, so put the most important information there. If you don\u2019t center your text, you run the risk of some of it being cut off when people are scrolling through.Don\u2019t forget that Insta adds information to the bottom of the screen, like your account name and when the story was posted. Don\u2019t let that drown out the info.Add a SoundtrackSource Namroud GorguisYes, most people will watch your story without the sound on. But there are going to be those who don\u2019t mute it.Consider adding music to help reinforce the images on the screen and set the mood.I Don\u2019t Want All That Effort to Go to WasteGot a video that you\u2019re really happy with? One you\u2019ve spent some time producing that you don\u2019t want to head off into the sunset after twenty-four hours? Then click on your story, and then the \u201cHighlight\u201d button.You\u2019ll have to rename the file, but once you\u2019ve done this, it will feature on your business\u2019s profile page.Aim to Be on the Explore PageIf you can get your post onto the \u201cExplore\u201d page, you can boost views significantly. The way to do this is by assigning the right hashtags and encouraging engagement.This is not the same as the Popular page on the site. Each person\u2019s Explore page is populated with content based on what they have liked and commented on before.Want Some Simple Ideas to Get Started?Of course, most readers at this point will have decided that the Stories feature is a good bet for businesses. But getting started is another story. How do you decide what to post?In the next section of this post, we\u2019ll go through some easy ideas for creating content effortlessly.Just remember that the videos have to be short.There are programs that you can use to create a series of short vids, but the best tactic is to stick with short and sweet videos that get to the point.Tutorials: Obviously, you are not going to be able to show someone how to create a masterpiece painting in the allotted time, but you can show them simple things. And if the tutorials feature your products, you score bonus points.A Behind the Scenes Look: This might seem like a bit of a corny thing to share, but a lot of people are interested in what goes on behind the scenes, or they want meet the support staff. It\u2019s a way of letting potential clients see the care that goes into making a product and helps them connect with the brand at a deeper level.Use It to Break News: Okay, so you\u2019re not going to want to post information about how Larry in accounting\u2019s bunion is doing, but if you have some interesting news to share, this is a great place to do it. Has there been a major breakthrough in your industry? Are you getting in a new product line? Talk about it.Make a Listicle: When all else fails, create a list of the top ten anything. Ideally you should stick to things that are related to your business in some way. So a travel agent could, for example, choose the Top Ten Bucket List Destinations. The idea is to create a short list with great visuals and information that is easy to scan.Our Top Hints to Keep in MindSource Fynn schmidtTell a StoryThe picture above is infinitely more interesting than the standard ones that we see of the Giza plateau because there\u2019s some life in it.You can almost imagine the cart driver calling out or see yourself climbing on a camel.The best Stories are actually stories. Make sure that your videos have a logical sequence to them.Be RealYou want to present great content, but you want it to be real. Your videos don\u2019t have to be perfect, or even too polished, as long as the message is sincere.People know that nothing is perfect \u2014 anything that looks too perfect might be written off as fake.Make Sure Your Content Adds ValueLong, in-depth videos about why your brand is the best are going to stroke your ego but do little else besides.Audiences on social media go there for fun, and they want the brands to provide them with good valueThis could be something that\u2019s informative or something that is purely entertaining. The point is, aim to create value for your audiences with every post you make.That way, they\u2019ll want to keep checking your page and are more likely to share posts.Don\u2019t Forget CreativityInsta is a less formal setting, so make sure you use it to its full advantage by getting creative with posts.This creativity will allow your brand to stand out on the channel.That\u2019s a WrapIn this post we\u2019ve aimed to give you an overview of Instagram Stories and why your business should be using it.If you still feel that this is not the channel for you, why not check out this post about marketing on Facebook?If you\u2019ve decided that Instagram is the right channel for your business, and you have some inspiration for creating your first story, why not let us know what step you\u2019ll take next?Comment below to let us know what you\u2019re planning.Publisher BioAlex Slichnyi, community manager at 99Firms.com, is an avid learner of all things IT.

I also condensed these down a little to only include the most important information.Please, note I did not go to all presentations so I\u2019m sure there were a lot of things I missed but these where the big impact talks I saw!Brendan Yell \u2014 Director at Sendgrid Email is still one of the top converting acquisition channels and Brendan shared some great stats they have collected from the users of SendGrid.3 words in the subject line for cold emails usually perform the best.As a company, you need to figure out what your overall CPA (cost per acquisition) is to know how much you can spend on ads to build your email list.Map out your exact funnel. Where do people first hear about you? when do they signup to your list? when do they convert?Content discoveryEmail sign upHow many ads do they seeDo they watch video contentWhen do they convertAb test 1 thing at a time. It is easy to get carried away with testing but the best thing to do is choose 1 thing at a time to A/B split test.Use segmentation to get personal. Just using their first name is not good enough. You need to segment and really understand at talk to that customer\u2019s pain point. Some easy segmentations are:How often they use your productHow long they have been using your productLead or customerHappy customer or notAim to deliver emails that are timely, relevant, personal, regional.Instead of having unsubscribed, use email frequency adjustment options send daily, weekly, monthly etc.More email marketing tactics and advice hereNavin Danapal \u2014 SOSV China Accelerator Was super excited to see this talk as I find the Chineses and Indian markets to be the up and coming. Not only do they have huge populations but the countries middle class is growing unlike the shrinking ones in the United States, Australia, and Europe.The next large market to service is China with 1 trillion eCommerce spend a year now.This market is lacking in saas and marketing products to feed this huge online economy.China is a lot harder for startups to work with. One big deterrent is having to potentially hand over your product source code to the Chinese government.WeChat pay integration is one of the top payment processors in the country, that along with AliPay from AliExpress.15 trillion mobile payments of which 50% are conducted through AliPay, think of it as an alternative to Stripe.WeChat has differentiated from a \u201cregular\u201d chat app as it is a building back with a huge collection and marketplace of apps.

In my personal opinion, it\u2019s a bit of everything, improve all of these 1% a week to keep growing.AcquisitionConversion rateRetentionJust spend 1 hour a week looking at your analytics and come up with 1 change to A/B test. Week after week you will get improvements.Talk to your customersWhy do you like our product?Why do you use our product?How did you find out product?What don\u2019t you like about our product?Focus on the customer. They are also people, so treat them like that, not a number. Too many people in marketing are not paying attention to the feedback they get from customers.Make something people like to use. Most people use up to 700 products a year. Make yours\u2019s the one they come back to time and time again.Aim for someone to use your product just 1\u20132 times a week.Andrew Lindsay \u2014 Business Development at Hubspot There are some huge case studies that show how partnership marketing has helped propel companies from 0 to 100 very quickly.Take Google partnering with Google back in the day.

In the interview he spoke about how StackSocial used giveaways to build a $10m+ empire without touching any outside funding (they raised $800,000 but never used any of it).I got one really great line from this interview. Payne said for giveaways to work, you should offer something that\u2019s compelling + relevant. That\u2019s a really good way to put it. One of the biggest issues I see from giveaways that don\u2019t succeed is that they don\u2019t fit with one or the other \u2014 even worse if they don\u2019t meet both.But finding that balance that can be tough. Giving away something that\u2019s not super relevant will hurt the quality of your leads. Giving away something that\u2019s really compelling might end up being too expensive. The tough part to giveaways is finding that balance. We wrote a series of blog posts that attack this topic (check out the blog posts re: the funnels).He also mentioned that he gives away free products. That\u2019s another feature built into the pro version of VYPER called \u201copt-in bribes\u201d \u2014 we give you the ability to give away free stuff to people who won\u2019t even win.The second interview was with The Drip Club founders on the Growth Everywhere podcast, where they talked about giving away 6-figures worth of retail value through giveaways and how much it helped build up their brand.The big takeaway from this interview was that you can giveaway 6-figures of stuff without actually having to pay for any of it. This is done by building up your brand. Once you have a big brand, companies are willing to give you free stuff.If you\u2019re looking to start your next giveaway, why not try VYPER?Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "New Feature \u2014 The Gamified Growth Widget", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/new-feature-the-gamified-growth-widget-43fccdd6fc45?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-12-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-18", "readtime": "4.36", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "New Feature \u2014 The Gamified Growth WidgetVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowDec 18, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWe\u2019re all about viral gamification and growth. That\u2019s why we continue to innovate and improve our product month after month.So, without any more fluff, we would like to introduce the widget that\u2019s going to grow your business like never before!See all the innovative ways you can use this new marketing tool below to grow your email list, social following, engagement and market awareness.This new feature in VYPER will help business owners do 2 things.1 \u2014 Add their viral contest or giveaway to any page and allow visitors to signup, complete bonus actions and check leaderboard without leaving the page.2 \u2014 Open up the option to create a gamified evergreen lead generation funnel using milestone rewards.How does it work?You design the new widget within the VYPER dashboard just like you would a contest or giveaway. There is a walkthrough video below as well as these guided steps.If you\u2019re running a contest or giveaway you can choose a prize like usual. Something that is of high value to your target marketing is always good.But if you\u2019re creating an evergreen lead magnet, it\u2019s best to choose coupon codes or digital assets as the milestone rewards.You can see an example of the evergreen milestone reward on this post. Unlock guides and digital assets for completing bonus actions and referring others to collect points. Once you reach 100 points you unlock a reward.First, grab users attention with a punchy one-line notification (see above or to the bottom left of screen), as soon as visitors hover over the notification it expands into the lead capture form.You can be used as a contest or an evergreen lead capture tool.Below you can see a snapshot of what the expanded state of the widget looks like. This section allows you to add more information to your \u201chook\u201d which is usually a reward or prize in exchange for an email.The example below is to get access to a video training library but a few other hooks you could use are:A contest or giveaway (win XXXXX, winners drawn weekly)A downloadable guide, checklist or cheatsheetDiscounts (get $10 off)Free plus shipping (get a free pair of sunglasses \u2014 coupon 100% off product, just pay shipping)Access to something (videos, members area, event, course etc)Below you can see an example of how you can also add extra fields that show up after the visitor start typing their email in if you like.Great for collecting phone number, gender, website, location etc. This is used to collect more information on your lead if you wish to.Once the entrant enters, you are then confronted with a few options.Wither you use this as a milestone reward tool or a contest tool the below are the basic fundamentals as to how we get people to either refer others to your business or complete bonus actions (share, follow or engage)From the 1 widget we allow website visitors to see:How many points they haveHow they can earn more pointsHow many points until they unlock their next rewardBelow is a quick video on how to set up and use the widget. The main things to remember is \u201cwhat can I offer my website visitors that will get them excited?\u201d.People are getting harder and harder to engage, the \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d factor is higher than ever. If you want to get visitors to follow you, share your content and hand over an email address, you need to offer them something GOOD!Some ideas on how to use the widget for growthAdd contests or giveaways to any page. Just add a line of code in the <body>, it will take you 30 seconds.Discount milestones. Use the usual discount offer \u2014 $5 off in exchange for your email, then they enter the VYPER growth points system. As they collect points they get higher discounts. Require them to refer friends, share content, follow on social and more to get $10 off, then $20 off etc.Use this widget as an evergreen referral tool. Get visitors to refer others to unlock rewards (content, downloads, access, discounts, free product etc).E.g. Refer 5 people get our free growth hacking course (valued $1299).Take your content upgrades to the next level. Require visitors to complete actions like watching a video or share a post to unlock the content upgrade. (see the example on this page)So, now that getting your users to engage, share and communicate with your brand is easier than ever. Set up a campaign and let us know how it goes!The main takeaways:Offer a good reward (something your target market would like).Add the widget to the homepage of your website for maximum exposure.Prioritize sharing (share on Facebook for 50 points, or retweet XXX for 50 points).Keep visitors coming back to complete bonus actions and refer others (email, messenger etc.).If you need some ideas, add a comment below with our company and we can suggest a campaign for you.What prize or reward to offerIf you should use an evergreen milestone contest or a regular oneWhat bonus actions to chooseHappy growth hacking, join our Facebook group for more growth hacks and share this post with someone who needs help getting their content or product shared.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How To Improve Your Facebook Engagement Rate", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-improve-your-facebook-engagement-rate-a106999fa71e?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-28", "readtime": "2.54", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "How To Improve Your Facebook Engagement RateVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowDec 28, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readSocial engagement is fast becoming a strong influence on customers buyer decision making. A popular product is a good product!This growth hack will show you how to gamify your Facebook engagement rate and take it through the roof.There\u2019re some huge reasons as to why you will want to improve your Facebook engagement rate.Your posts get better organic reach.Your posts become more \u201cscroll stopping\u201d.Your ad relevancy scores are better when you use the same posts in your ad campaigns (see the video below on how to do this).Using the same post in multiple ad sets helps pool your social validation.The \u201cpage health\u201d (engagement, activity etc) is an important factor in Facebook identifying quality brands.You may think that all of these things are small pieces of the puzzle but social platforms are viciously trying to filter posts, people and content based on quality.One of the top the metrics is shares and comments. \ud83d\ude32This tells Facebook that the content is good. The more people you have sharing and engaging the more Facebook will show the post.Watch this video a second time if you get lost but the outlined steps are below to follow as well. We use the VYPER tool to achieve this.A few examples of how brands are using this tacticRunning weekly or monthly giveaways (constant stream of gamified engagement). ExampleRun a 30\u201345 day contest or giveaway to get one big engagement lift (product/event launch etc). ExampleCreate an evergreen milestone rewards contest. ExampleFollow These StepsCreate a post \u2014 ideally, you want to create a post that you plan to use as an ad later on. You can do 1 post about your contest or just do this for a post about your product. If you are looking for some ideas on how to create a good Facebook post that converts, check out this post.Create a contest \u2014 you can use templates to get this created super quickly. Offer something of value to your target market. We have seen a lot of companies use this on an evergreen \u201cweekly\u201d or \u201cmonthly\u201d winner.This allows brands to continually collect social engagements, not just for a short period of time while they are running a contest.Create your bonus action \u2014 again, this is a template that you can easily load into your contest. We have pre-built this in as so many people are using it.Dark post \u2014 remember to always use the correct \u201cpost id\u201d when choosing the \u201cexisting post\u201d option in ads manager.Turn your post into an ad \u2014 once you have built up some social engagement from your contest. Take that post and turn it into an ad.Scale the post \u2014 start by introducing the post to your remarketing audiences. Then start using it in your look-a-like and interest prospecting audiences.So if you do any marketing on social media this is a great strategy to boost your Facebook engagement rate, Twitter engagements, Pinterest repins etc.The possibilities are endless for this, you just follow the same process but change out the social post. We just use Facebook in this example is it is the most common one.Get out there and start growth hacking.Add below what you think of this tactic and any other ways you have seen success in boosting your engagement rate.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "10 B2C Facebook Ads Deconstructed", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/10-b2c-facebook-ads-deconstructed-5078814a2ca4?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-09-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-12", "readtime": "7.91", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "10 B2C Facebook Ads DeconstructedVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 12, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readOne ad can be the difference between Facebook being your number 1 acquisition channel or the channel that plummets you into debt.A beauty & a beat at the same time!So, how do you create winning ads and avoid wasting money on ads that do not work?Take a look at the 12 Facebook ads below, we have torn them apart and pointed out what the company did right and what they did wrong!Note that these posts were ads with \u201cshop now\u201d or \u201clearn more\u201d CTA\u2019s but they get removed when viewing the post URL instead of in the feed as an ad.Facebook Ad 1 \u2014 Koala MattressLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThey made full use of video and added captions, 90% of people watch Facebook videos with sound off.They demonstrate something \u201camazing\u201d about the product. Fist jumping on a mattress with a wine glass, second the option to adopt/support a Koala in need. This shows the quality of the product and also adds an emotional pull towards the band.They are calling out \u201ccouples\u201d and probably targeting people in a relationship. Always try and align your targeting with you ad messaging (vice versa).What they did wrongThey could have added a lot more to the text area, no everyone wants to watch a video.They did not add a link in the text area, this is a lost CTA opportunity.Facebook Ad 2 \u2014 Lululemon MenLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightGreat use of the carousel ad format showing the product in \u201cproduct + lifestyle\u201d shots.Did a good job at featuring the same model in multiple locations using the jacket for multiple use case scenarios.They mentioned features on each slide, makes users want to scroll through.What they did wrongAgain the text areas were underutilized, add a link to the product, features about the product, pricing, sale opportunity, limited stock, the collection (e.g. winter).They should have made use of the carousel card description area. Even if it is just the price or the brand name, this is an easy way to include some extra information.Facebook Ad 3 \u2014 Arcadia PowerLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightGreat use of incentivization. Instead of getting into a pricing war with competitors they are adding extra value. Since this was a new product at the time and trending this added a lot of perceived value.Explained how \u201ceasy\u201d it was to get the Google Home Mini.What they did wrongNot clear what the ad is about, the image could have been more focused on the core product as opposed as a lifestyle shot of the bonus product.The title is cut off, make sure you stay within these limits otherwise people can not get the full message.Needed to use paragraphs in the text area to split up the text a little more and make it more \u201creadable\u201dShould have included a CTA in the text either to a link or click on the CTA button of the ad.Facebook Ad 4 \u2014 MasterClassLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightAwesome use of celebrity endorsement, this is extremely powerful when socially validating the quality of a product. Who doesn\u2019t want to be taught how to cook like Gordon or play basketball like Curry.This is a gifting ad but cold quite easily be a prospecting ad as well. The benefit of the gifting ad is that you have multiple friends that come to mind with each \u201cskill\u201d being taught. Much better than using a single image ad.What they did wrongCould have split the text into 2 sentences. First explaining why this is a good gift idea. Then secondly explaining the quality of the gift.Could have added special pricing for a gift subscription and made it a limited offer.Could have turned this into a BOGO. Buy a subscription for a friend and get 6 months free for yourself.FREE Guide: What we learned from spending $100 million on Facebook ads! [Download Here]Facebook Ad 5 \u2014 JumpcutLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis is a personal ad that looks very organic. This would be fantastic for remarketing if they were already familiar with who this is.Great use of the creative size. This ad is using a very tall ratio which will take up the whole screen.They have added captions to help people who do not have sound enabled.Have created scarcity around the closing time for the sale.Cleverly they are only giving away 12 months instead of a lifetime account.What they did wrongDid not include the value of the course while it was not on sale. E.g. \u201cthis course usually costs over $699 a year but if you enroll before 11:59pm PST you can get it for only %97 (that\u2019s 96% OFF the regular price)\u201dThey should have tried to get the link above the \u201cview more\u201d cut off. This would have improved CPC and CTR.Facebook Ad 6 \u2014 Mighty AudioLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis is a great example of leveraging another brand to make your product more authoritative.Great use of a collaboration offer and using the brands\u2019 logos in the image help demonstrate the partnership as well.If they were targeting people interest in Spotify they would have been able to get instant recognition and trust from that audience.Very clear function and value proposition.What they did wrongCould have added a list of all the times you would want to use Spotify without a phone. This would have helped people connect with the ad. You want to generate that \u201cyeah.. me too\u201d feeling.This ad would not have looked very organic in the Facebook newsfeed. Using a lifestyle shot with a smaller logo and product feature might have made this a little less \u201cad\u201d looking.Facebook Ad 7 \u2014 Mama HomeLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis ad is a fantastic demonstration of what the product does. It gives a lot of examples, clear explanation of how it works and what it does. Even better they do this quickly.the copy is using emojis to break it up.They are using arrows to the CTA as well as telling people where to click.Calling out free shipping as another advantage.What they did wrongThe first frame shouldn\u2019t have been a pregnant lady, it should have been an example of their most popular demo or use. E.g. leg waxing or a nose pore cleaning.They might have been able to use a shorter link, this would have taken up less space on mobile ads.They did not mention the price. This would have been a good split test but using the price in the ad can prep visitors to buy.Facebook Ad 8 \u2014 PatagoniaLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightFantastic image creative, showing items that all make up an outfit.They are appealing to people who value social/corporate responsibility. This probably aligns with their target market/ideal persona. They could also target interest groups that include charities, sustainability etc.Great explainer of the process they use to make their product, this also increases the perceived value of this product.What they did wrongThe text needs to be formatted so that it is easier to read. Use of emojis, symbols or paragraphs would have helped get the point across easier.They could have also included a link in the text.If they had a short video on the process this would have done better in terms of capturing peoples attention, then tagging products in on video or even remarketing people who watch over 50% of the video.Facebook Ad 9 \u2014 MentorboxLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightAgain, great use of the tall video takes up the whole screen on mobile. On a desktop you get the blurred buffer on each side but it is a small price to pay to take up so much real estate in the feed.Got to 3 million views, this must have cost a LOT of money considering their engagement is so low.Organic looking post.What they did wrongNo captions on this is a huge conversion killer. Especially because the video size is optimized for video as well. Facebook has auto-translate as well as .srt file uploads.Very little information and no link in the text area.The backdrop should have been all books so the video creative was balanced and people would focus on the speaker instead of the cars on the highway in the bottom left. Make sure you set up 1 focal point in your videos.Facebook Ad 10 \u2014 MooLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightUsing Press or Customer quotes are a great way to build trust and social validation.Using a \u201cunique\u201d image + product placement.Out of most peoples control but having a verified page helps, ask your Facebook rep if you are eligible!!!!Offering a discount, if this was a remarketing campaign to push me over the edge to complete my purchase.What they did wrongThey could have made the image more engaging. E.g. used an impressive design on the business cards, use a unique shape or fabric to show of the customizability of the service.Included more benefits of the product under the quote in the text area. It was great adding the quote but then what\u2026.. why is the product such high quality? how do they create a good first impression?As you can see there are many aspects that go into making a successful ad. The key take aways are.Make your ads stand out by being unique.Use a creative image or video sizes (square or 4:5 ratio)A lot can be done in the text area, use emojis, links, paragraphs, CAPS, lines, arrows. Whatever you can to make the text easy to read, entertaining and educational.Make sure your ad engages, teaches or entertains. You need to give someone a reason to stop scrolling!!!!FREE Guide: What we learned from spending $100 million on Facebook ads!

Their products are all gun-related, and thus were not compliant with rules on these networks. They needed to get a little bit more creative with their lead generation efforts. Enter viral competitions.Contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/914Below is a short Q&A session we had with the founder Eric about his experience using VYPER to run a viral contest! Pew Pew Tactical is a firearm learning resource blog that focuses on the complete newbie to create a friendly learning environment.Why did PewPewTactical.com decide to run a contest?We decided to run a contest mainly because we were seeing competitors running them to great success. Doing some research and asking fellow entrepreneurs led me to try out VYPER as our platform due to their social sharing tools.We are also in a niche that is restricted on paid channels such as Facebook and Google ad networks. This was another organic lead generation option.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work?The best comparison would be against our content upgrade run through Sumo popups for a shooting target PDF in return for an email address. It performed OK at .91% signup percentage.How did your contest perform in terms of your other marketing campaigns?With a much better offer in the content (ability to win a cool rifle handguard and two other prizes), our email signup jumped to 4.92%\u2026a 441% increase.Results from campaign2,229 new emails171% increase in Facebook reactions7.2% increase in website traffic during contentsWhat are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?Having a 2nd & 3rd place prize helped increase signupsGiving additional entries per referral seemed to help (we did 3x)Image is really important\u2026TEST!Send to your list multiple times.Ok to have a longer time duration (we did 2 weeks but could have done up to 4).What would you do next time you ran a contest?Create/use higher quality header and share images.Higher budget for prizes.Integrate a digital bribe along with entries.Post in Reddit, related forums, etc.Get influencers and companies involved to share.How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?FB sharing and hitting our own email list did the best. But that might be since our other social avenues are a little underdeveloped.I\u2019m definitely looking forward to going much bigger with the next giveaway\u2026 bigger prizes and reaching out to our influencer network. Now that I know it works and VYPER does the job well\u2026 I\u2019m ready to ask for influencer help.What is the value of an email lead to you and how are you going to monetize these new leads?The value of a lead is around $6 (contest generated $13k+ in rev value) and we\u2019re looking to monetize by adding them to our newsletter where we send informative articles with affiliate links and also to our online store with apparel and accessories.About The CompanyWebsite \u2014 https://www.pewpewtactical.comContest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/914Pew Pew Tactical started off as a personal blog but soon grew into one of the top firearm learning resources.

But why use interactive content in the first place? What\u2019s so great about it?As it turns out, interactive content is the future of marketing. And I\u2019m not talking about just contests \u2014 I\u2019m talking about everything. Marketing itself is becoming more and more interactive every day. Contests are a piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s time to look at the big picture.This Is Your Brain on InteractionFor decades, marketing has created passive users. How many times have you seen the same ad over and over again? Maybe there\u2019s something unique about it, but ultimately it\u2019s just an ad. You\u2019re passive while watching it. You don\u2019t get to experience the brand.That\u2019s been changing recently thanks to interactive content. Interactive content is any kind of content that allows the user to directly participate. Contests, quizzes, games, and surveys are just a few examples.Interactive content is getting so big because marketers are figuring out that users want to experience a brand first-hand. When marketing collides with the real world, users get a completely new experience.A great example is how Reebok advertised their new shoes in Stockholm. A speed cam was mounted on a small outdoor kiosk. Anyone who ran faster than 17kph won a free pair of shoes. This was no ordinary ad; this was an experience that transformed ordinary passersby into runners.Those people who interacted with the ad came away with a one-of-a-kind memory. The interaction led to something bigger (the ability to break away from the day and have fun), and that left a lasting impression.Interaction is a way of transforming your users. The reason that people love grandiose stories is because most people live rather plain lives. Many are unsatisfied with their life. Stories give them a way to escape, and directly participating in a story is even more cathartic. Compare this to passively viewing an ad, which seems pathetically weak compared to the interaction.Marketing needs disruption. It needs a future that\u2019s free of clickbait ads and spammy email marketing. We\u2019re living in an age of value, and we need to be giving our users the best experience ever. Interaction is a great way of doing that.Creating InteractionInteraction comes in all shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s not a one size fits all scenario. Different forms of interaction will work with different brands. For example, it would be comical if a law firm started using Snapchat. It\u2019s key to identify the types of interactive content that work well with your brand.Interaction is created whenever your user has the opportunity to participate in your brand. This includes social networks, comment sections, and interactive media (contests, quizzes, etc.). This isn\u2019t an all-inclusive list, however, as there are constantly new ways to interact with users. But for this article, we\u2019ll focus on these three areas.Interaction on social networksSocial networks are probably what you think of when you hear \u201cinteraction\u201d and \u201cusers.\u201d Many people have several social network accounts, which also means that they have more opportunities to participate.But this is where most brands go wrong. They think that the inherent capabilities of social networks (liking, commenting, sharing) are interactive enough. And they\u2019re dead wrong. The abilities to like, comment, and share are great, but to truly stand out, you need to use these as a means to an end, not the end itself.For instance, if someone is scrolling through their Twitter feed and sees a Promoted Tweet, they might feel a bit jaded about it, especially if it\u2019s a thinly veiled sales tactic like a coupon code with a description that resembles a meme.But imagine if someone\u2019s scrolling through Twitter and sees what looks like the first sentence of a book. It\u2019s a Promoted Tweet, all right, but it\u2019s strange. If they click more, they discover a micro-story about your brand. It might not translate into a sale, but it has a much better chance than a traditional ad.This is just one example \u2014 social networks are ideal places to experiment with interactive content. Take advantage of their social capabilities, and use them to create standout interactionInteraction in comment sectionsThis seems pretty straightforward, but so many brands do it wrong. How many times have you seen comment sections with no participation from the brand? Generally, brands only respond when people complain.But when brands devote time to responding to users\u2019 comments, both good and bad, it creates an interesting dialogue. Most people still see brands as faceless entities, so by responding, you\u2019re giving your brand a friendly face. You\u2019re bridging the gap between brand and consumer, and that\u2019s something the consumer will always appreciate.Or you can think outside the box. We\u2019ll use the example of creating a short story on Twitter. What if you created a short story in comment sections? Readers could follow your latest post to get updates on the story. Obviously this isn\u2019t for every brand, but it\u2019s an interesting thought experiment that should get you thinking about what you can do with \u201cordinary\u201d tools.Interactive mediaHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting. Interactive media like contests and quizzes are fully user-based. The user gets to choose their own adventure, so to speak, and participate in the brand. This is a new phenomenon, but the rising popularity of interactive media shows that it really works, and it\u2019s powerful.Interactive media can also create new leads from thin air. It sounds magical, but it\u2019s 100% true. Say someone stumbles upon your site and finds a fun quiz. They take it and then get an offer to sign up for more content like that. If they enjoyed the quiz, they\u2019ll likely sign up.And contests are perfect for lead generation because everyone wants to win, and they want to be notified if they win. It\u2019s almost unfair how powerful these techniques are.Of course, you have to consistently produce amazing content. If someone signs up for a contest and gets only boring sales emails from you, they\u2019re going to unsubscribe. But if you keep producing interesting, relevant content (both interactive and traditional), you\u2019ll have a much better retention rate.Giving up the powerIf you remember one thing from this article, let it be this. When you\u2019re creating interactive experiences (or doing any sort of marketing, for that matter), give the power over to the user. Don\u2019t try to sell to people \u2014 give them an adventure that happens within the world of your brand.Those people who interacted with the Reebok ad didn\u2019t feel like they were being sold to. They felt like they were taking part in something fun. That should be your goal with interactive content. Give up the power, and you might be surprised at the results.Ian Chandler is a narrative marketer and writer based in Ohio. He helps businesses leverage the power of story at Narrative Marketers.

I\u2019d like to share some practical tips you can implement to increase your email open rate, click through rate and actually get more cash in your bank account. Yeah that\u2019s a pretty big aim :DThe tips get more advanced as the article progresses. The last tip, which I\u2019ve never seen shared before in a blog post, will benefit you most if you\u2019re already established online with an email list (be that an E-commerce store owner, a blogger, software founder or whatever).Let\u2019s get started!1. How to Structure Your EmailForm follows function; The phrase was initially coined by the architect Louis Sullivan and is based on the principle that the shape of a structure should be determined by its function.You can and should apply the same logic to writing your sales emails, because, each part of your email has a specific purpose.Everything starts with your subject line.The job of the subject line, and nowadays the first line of your copy, is to get your customer to open the email. And you guessed it, the job of the copy is to get the reader to click on the link.You\u2019re not making a sale, that\u2019s the purpose of the sales page.2. Embedding Links: The Magic NumberGood email copy is structured to give your reader multiple opportunities to take the action you desire (in this case getting them to click on you link). The more links you use, up to a point, the higher your click through rate.You can see the results in the graph below from research Campaign Monitor did when they analysed click through rates from 500 million emails.Yet just placing the same link multiple times in your copy isn\u2019t going to significantly increase your click through rate.Click through rate vs number of links. Research by Campaign Monitor.Think of your email copy as a story. There\u2019s a beginning, a middle and an end. At each stage of the copy you are trying to get your reader to click on the link and leave the story.You\u2019ll need to use different arguments to achieve this.For example: you can open your pitch by appealing to a person\u2019s curiosity, follow it up with a list of benefits they\u2019d get by clicking on the link and end the email by highlighting the urgency of completing the action. Check out the example email above to see what I mean.3. How to Get Those ClicksThere are certain places in your sales copy where dropping a link just works. Embed your link after a list of bullet points that summarise the benefits of the product you are selling or after a product testimonial for example.Finally you\u2019ve got the postscript (which happens to be the second most clicked link in an email).To get those brain cells bubbling here\u2019s a list of six different ways you can use a postscript to generate sales.Images and buttons are proven ways to get additional clicks and increase your click through rates. The case for using a button in your email copy as a call to action is pretty clear cut.You\u2019ll find dozens of case studies, like this one, that show a jump, in this case 28%, in click through rate when using a button as your main call to action over a text link.An example of the A/B test ran by Wistia. In this example they saw a 24.83% increase in click through rate for the video thumbnail over the image.Another obvious way to use images in your email sales copy is creating a video thumbnail (obviously there should be a video to watch on the sales page).When Wistia tested video thumbnails in emails compared to regular images they saw a 25% jump in their click through rate.Another important variable to test that will have a huge impact on your success is subject lines. Check out this list of the best performing subject lines to use in your net campaign.4. Create a CliffhangerThink of your favorite TV series. How did it end last week? I bet there was some unfinished business awaiting a resolution in the next episode.Now think about how you run your email marketing campaigns. Do your readers have anything to look forward to next week?You should be constantly playing with your reader\u2019s emotions, think flirtatious girlfriend rather than American Psycho, to generate sales or increase click through rates.Also experiment. Create expectation for your promo with a free giveaway and then add a postscript regarding upcoming offer for example.5. Never Deceive Your AudienceObvious right? Not lying to your audience sounds like such an obvious step, but you\u2019ll be surprised how many marketers fall into this trap (often, and I include myself in this list, with the best of intentions). Yet these innocent lies, like that email you promised to send them, add up!If you say you\u2019re going to send an email to your list on a given day then send it. You mention your promotion or sale will close on a given date and time then close the offer at that time and implement that price rise that you threatened.When you don\u2019t do these things your scarcity threats become less effective and your audience will stop believing everything you say.6. Learn from a ProThe most successful email marketer I know stopped writing \u2018original\u2019 copy four years ago. Instead he adapts email series developed and used by marketing maestros like Frank Kern and Ryan Deiss for his business.An email marketing course by one of these guys will cost cost $2,000 and up.However, if you are making money from your list already and want to take your business to the next level then these courses are worth the investment.One of the best courses I completed was The Machine by Ryan Deiss. It\u2019s well structured and guides you through the system Digital Marketer use to manage and profit from their email list across various niches.The course includes access to a half dozen turnkey email series and some rock solid theory you can apply to your business.Now I know what you might be thinking; I don\u2019t have $2k to drop on an email course. And I can relate. It\u2019s a lot of cash to invest.If you want to learn from some of the best copywriters on the cheap sign up to a bunch of different email lists from successful marketers. You\u2019ll get a ton of valuable content, it just won\u2019t be in a structured format.7. Recycle Old ContactsGrowing your email list can feel frustrating. While you\u2019re always getting new subscribers many people already on your list stop opening your emails.Most marketers will tell you to get rid of these dud emails, because they\u2019re going to reduce your open rate, which is true. But\u2026Instead of simply deleting these contacts I recommend storing these contacts on a separate email-marketing provider. You don\u2019t need to put much effort in managing them.Every 30 days or so send a general email to these contacts; this can be a blog post, discount offer, re-engagement series or whatever.The open rate for these emails will be tiny. That\u2019s fine. You will get people re-engaging with your emails and your products though. When you do recycle these engaged customers back onto your main email list.There are no excuse for not doing this!Plenty of companies offer free trials for up to 2,000 subscribers so it doesn\u2019t need to cost you a penny.You\u2019ll get better results, and more profits, from your promotions when you send an email series.8. Flood the Inbox (occasionally)You shouldn\u2019t use this tip to often as it will burn out your list, but\u2026 When you\u2019re pushing a hot product, especially when it\u2019s a time sensitive offer, the best way to generate sales is the frequency of your emails.During an average 3\u20135 day promotion we send at least 10 segmented emails.I recommend sending a minimum of four segmented emails during a promotion. Send your first email to open the offer.Follow this up two hours later with an email to people who didn\u2019t open that first email. On the last day of the promotion send another two emails (the second one to the people who didn\u2019t open the first). And that\u2019s a minimum!To increase sales segment your list further by sending custom emails to people who opened the link to those that just opened the email (the fancy name for this is behavioral response indicators.There\u2019s a nice post by Frank Kern here that should get you thinking).Just like when you\u2019re embedding links into your email copy, you need to be using different angles to get people to open and stay engaged with your offers (you can\u2019t bludgeon a person into buying a product by repeating the same thing 10 times).Compose email series that hit different emotional triggers, like emotion, logic and urgency, to maximise your click through rate to the sales page.9. Run Your List on Two Email Service ProvidersEmail service providers like Gmail and Yahoo use complex algorithms to assign emails into different folders (like the hated spam). There are a lot of factors to consider, but one which many people overlook is the company you are using to send your emails.So first tip, choose a company that only lets you upload verified email addresses (sorry Aweber). Once you\u2019ve got that sorted, an easy way to improve your open rate and reach more customers is to host and send emails to your list from two different servers/ companies.Running your email list on two servers will help you reach more of your email list.If you do this don\u2019t send the same email twice at different times, which would look spammy. Instead create two messages with the same purpose (here\u2019s a nice article on keeping your list engaged while sending valuable content) and send them at different times to your list.This will get you extra clicks, which add up quickly when you\u2019re running a promotion!FREE BONUS \u2014 7 growth hack tactices to double your websites revenue!

I\u2019d love to hear your feedback in the comments below.Or better yet, share some tips of your own that could benefit other marketers.That\u2019s all I have to share for the moment, but I still want to help you out. I run special offers with software startups for lifetime access to useful marketing tools to help you grow your email list and manage your online business (we ran a great campaign with VYPER earlier in the year).This is a guest post by Nico Prins, to sign up to his no BS email list head over to Launch Space.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Email", "Email Marketing", "Lead Gen", "Lit Building"]}, {"title": "(Updated) How We Got on Product Hunt Without ANY Preparation & the Gobs of Money We Made", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/updated-how-we-got-on-product-hunt-without-any-preparation-the-gobs-of-money-we-made-14826892a9dc?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-05-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-24", "readtime": "4.96", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "(Updated) How We Got on Product Hunt Without ANY Preparation & the Gobs of Money We MadeVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowMay 29, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readOkay so gobs of money is a little bit of an overstatement, but Product Hunt gave us our first customers and helped us make a few thousand bucks (about $3,000 so far). Not bad!We all know what Product Hunt is right?This last weekend, VYPER was posted up on the site. We didn\u2019t plan for it to happen, but someone named Charlie Irish submitted us.Around 12pm I noticed we were getting traffic from Product Hunt after logging into Google Analytics. My first thought was, wtf? How?I went on to the site, and sure enough we were the 4th startup.My reaction was a mix of jubilation as well as horror. We had planned for a huge Product Hunt launch for a few weeks in the future, and now we lost several hours of planning time. We also had the timing of getting posted on Saturday, when the PH community was not super active. But it was time to make the best of it.I contacted my co-founder Jack and it was time to get to work.First we realized that we had some errors on our site that the PH community pointed out. We quickly fixed those (SSL certificate wasn\u2019t present and our sign up page was sending users to a new tab\u2026 DOH). Then it was time to get started promoting.Promotion StrategyFirst, I sent out emails to our email list, which contained approximately 2,000 people.During our software development phase, I spent time content marketing and amassing a list of entrepreneurs. By the time our launch rolled around, we had around 2,000 emails on this list. I sent out an email to the entire list about our Product Hunt launch. About 16% opened this email. Here\u2019s what I wrote:If you\u2019ve been following some of my last emails, you\u2019ll remember that we\u2019re launching a new product called VYPER, an email marketing tool that helps you create giveaways that collect email addresses.So I had absolutely NO idea that VYPER was going to be hunted on Product Hunt today. We had a whole strategy ready and everything with a big pre-launch reach-out, but I guess the community was ready for us before we were ready for them =) That\u2019s okay, we\u2019re going to make the best of it and try to promote our Product Hunt launch as much as possible!If anyone uses Product Hunt, your support is greatly appreciated. If you don\u2019t use it, today\u2019s a great day to sign up (hehe).Check out VYPER on the Product Hunt homepage (probably will only stay there until tomorrow).Your support is greatly appreciated.Cheers, Kevin(The following paragraph is now debunked) According to our sources, upvotes from the homepage give you more weight, so we told people about our Product Hunt posting and linked them to the Product Hunt homepage. The reason for this is because Product Hunt has a ranking algorithm to prevent cheating.UPDATED: Link directly to your product page. Linking to \u201cproducthunt.com\u201d only makes it harder for people to find you and doesn\u2019t have any effect on the algorithm at all. It seems to be \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that you\u2019re punished for linking directly to your product page \u2014 it\u2019s simply not true. Focus on communicating what your product does. P.S. Linking to producthunt.com is one of the clearest indications you may be \u201cover-optimizing\u201d your launch (gaming the system).Remember, Product Hunt doesn\u2019t like it when you ask for upvotes, so avoid doing it!Secondly, I talked to Slack groups.Not sure how well this strategy did for us because Saturday was DEAD in the Slack channels.My tip is to get well ingrained into each Slack group before your PH launch. Reach out to users in there who post interesting content and make friends. If someone else posts their Product Hunt launch, you should upvote and tell them that you did. This goes a HUGE way when you have your own launch. I had a couple buddies in the Slack groups that had done launches so I messaged them and they supported our launch as well.If you want to build up your network, Slack groups are a great way to do it.Third, I hit up people individually who were my tech-savvy friends.Pretty self explanatory, but the key is to network with people in startups & tech who know Product Hunt. Getting a 20\u201330 person boost was very helpful here. This is something that I never practiced before, but I realize how important having a good network of people in the same industry really is. Over the years I\u2019ve amassed a pretty large network, so it wasn\u2019t hard to get people to check out our Product Hunt posting.Fourth, I posted on Reddit.This strategy requires much more careful planning. This wasn\u2019t as successful as we wanted, but it still drove a few upvotes and I got about 2 emails from people saying they saw us on reddit.Here\u2019s what I posted in /r/entrepreneurGetting a Hunter (Updated)Product Hunt reached out and told us you no longer need a hunter to hunt your products. Here\u2019s an excerpt from their blog.Feel free to hunt your own product. Having someone else posting is fine, but spending lots of time \u201cfinding a hunter\u201d is a distraction. You know your product better than anyone else, and it makes very little difference who hunts the product and how well it performs overall. Follow these steps to get contributor access.If you\u2019re not sure whether your product would do well on Product Hunt, feel free to email me \u2014 kevin@vyper.io \u2014 for advice and suggestions.How did we do?Being that it was a Saturday and we had almost no preparation, our launch wasn\u2019t as successful as some others like Dollar Beard Club (apparently they got thousands of paying subscribers from Product Hunt), but we still got ~9,000 views to our site, about ~200 signups and a handful of paying members.We also got tweeted out by the Product Hunt team on Twitter and we retweeted their posts a couple times. Make sure you add yourself as the \u201cmaker\u201d of the product in order to get tweeted out. I had to email and Tweet at the Product Hunt team to get them to add my co-founder and me as the maker.We ended up #4 on the site for the day. Today we still get 40\u201360 views per day.Need help getting on Product Hunt?Email me, kevin@vyper.io, with your startup and I\u2019ll give you some personal tips and advice.

Wanna know which one is the best option for your project? Keep reading to find out.In this article I will provide you a concise overview of the most popular Ethereum programming languages available right now.By the end of it, you\u2019ll know exactly which option is the absolute best for your specific needs so that you don\u2019t waste time and resources on something too limited or hard to maintain.Be sure stick till the end for resources to learn more about each language.Here\u2019s the table of contents:VyperSoliditySerpentLLLThe best solution for youFinal verdict1. VyperVyper is a language similar to Python. It belongs to the \u201csimple\u201d group of languages where the focus is on the contract\u2019s security by simplicity.Those who are looking for more security-oriented languages, Vyper is the go-to platform because the goal of Vyper is to create more readable and easier to understand contracts which are also fully transparent. Essentially, Vyper represents an amalgamation of Solidity and Python of sorts.Viper is the successor to Serpent. It is under active development, mainly by Vitalik himself.From their own github:Vyper is a smart contract development language built with the following goals:Security \u2014 it should be possible and natural to build secure smart contracts in Vyper.Language and compiler simplicity \u2014 the language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.Auditability \u2014 Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.You can find it here: https://github.com/ethereum/vyperPros:Simple to use and highly readableDifficult to write buggy code because less complex functions remove the risk of making a mistakeCons:Limited support for advanced functionsDoesn\u2019t allow calling external methods from other smart contract2. SoliditySolidity is an intentionally loosely-typed programming language, quite similar to JavaScript with \u201c.sol\u201d as the file extension. It is currently the most used and supported programming language.It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.The best way to try out Solidity right now is using Remix. It\u2019s a web browser based IDE that allows you to write Solidity smart contracts, then deploy and run the smart contracts.Pros:Intentionally simple to write secure contractsMultiple type-safe functionsShortages in the program can be easily rectified through alternative strategiesCons:Because of it\u2019s popularity is the focus for hackers to attack contracts so new vulnerabilities cause lots of damageLimited in posibilities. You\u2019ll probably need an external oracle for more advanced projectsUpgradable contracts are still hard to developYou can learn more about it in the official docs: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/3. SerpentSerpent is fairly similar to Python. Serpent has a minimalistic syntax and dynamic typing features. Originally, Serpent was developed for usage in real-time systems, especially interactive multimedia systems.However, the appearance of Solidity exposed the many weaknesses of Serpent and ultimately kicked it to the curb. Nowadays it\u2019s not recommended.The Ethereum founder said about Serpent:Being a low-level language, Serpent is NOT RECOMMENDED for building applications unless you really really know what you\u2019re doing. The creator recommends Solidity as a default choice, LLL if you want close-to-the-metal optimizations, or Viper if you like its features though it is still experimental.Pros:Multiple independent instances can run simultaneously in the space of one addressCons:Independent audit performed by Zeppelin identified 8 critical vulnerabilitiesThe biggest flaw lies in the fact that hackers may change the date in which the REP token contract was created, thus freezing up the token supply4. LLLLisp Like Language (LLL) is one of the original programming languages for developing Ethereum smart contracts. This programming language has recently gained more popularity.Just like Python, it is meant to be simple and minimalistic. For instance, the platform offers direct access to memory and storage, therefore allowing for a more efficient performance. The code is simple, clean and straightforward.There\u2019s an excellent article written by consensys about that language for those that want to learn more about how to use it here: https://media.consensys.net/an-introduction-to-lll-for-ethereum-smart-contract-development-e26e38ea6c23LLL doesn\u2019t hide the highly resource-constrained nature of the EVM and enables efficient use of those limited resources.LLL facilitates the creation of very clean EVM code whilst removing the worst of the pain of coding for the EVM directly: namely stack management and jump management.Pros:Removes stack and jump management for more efficient developmentCons:Although it is simple, it is widely considered to be too basicThe lower level coding nature of this language makes code harder to manageNot recommended for more complex projects due to its simplicityYou can learn more in the official docs: https://lll-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lll_introduction.html5. The best solution for youAll programming languages are developed to target a specific audience and cater to the needs of a specific user group. The \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d principle is rarely applicable in the coding ecosystem as different developers want and require different features.Moreover, the decision as to which program to use often is taken out of the hands of developers and lies with the business owners.As far as developers are concerned, the division of simpler and more complex languages is clear. Use Vyper or LLL if you are looking for simple languages needed for less complex functions and smaller projects.On the other side, I recommend you to go with Solidity if you want to work on more complex problems. Thus, based on your level of knowledge and experience, you will pick your language of choice.Solidity is definitely the safest bet as it provides a great balance between simplicity, complexity and the overall quality of the final output.6. Final verdictAs explained in the first part of the article, there are many different programming languages currently available. Depending on your needs, budget and vision, different developers or business owners choose whatever fits their needs the best.In order to minimalize the risk, my advice would be to choose Solidity.

It was a very cool contest for people like me who could use those tools for our daily work. Of course, I joined without a second thought.Vyper.io concept is similar to Gleam.io and Rafflecopter.com which is not new in the market. So running their own Giveaway Contest is a good way to attract more people (potential customers).The registration process was simple and plain, they sent me an email to confirm and 10 points for verifying my email. The rules were simple, the more points you have the higher chance you win. Fair enough!You can get more point by doing some pre-defined actions, for ex: Like their FB, Join their FB Group, Review their course\u2026etc. Each action will give you different points.But to get past 500 points, you have to refer people to register through your link. Each person you referred will give you 100 points. At the time I joined the contest, the 1st position had 10k points, the 2nd had 5k points. To get in top 10, you must have at least 1k points.I was so into that contest with \u201cmust win\u201d thought in my mind. First I tried to find the Contest\u2019s Term/Rules to follow but found nothing but a line said that \u201cYou can\u2019t refer yourself or you will be disqualified\u201d. Ok, I understood.Next thing I thought: How to win this contest? I have to get at least 5k points to sit in top 3. That will give me a higher chance to win for sure.Before doing anything that costs money, I sent my ref link to all my friends on FB and emails. I messaged them and instructed them to register. I got about 10 friends joined, so 1k points for me. That action gave me sit into top 20 position.But I\u2019m a greedy person so I decided to start a FB Ads campaign for my ref link. (I still follow the contest rules) And here was the result:That was a smart move for me, I was happy to see my points going up every day. Yesterday, I got 5k points and hold #3 spot tightly. I was so close to #2, only 1\u2013200 points to get that position.And BAM! They slapped me in my face. I\u2019ve been disqualified for the reasons below. They didn\u2019t show any proof so I doubt that they just don\u2019t want to give rewards to people \u201cnot on their list\u201d.Without notification, that\u2019s all I get after spending a lot of time and money to promo their Contest. I try to find support on their Contest page but found nothing.So I decided to give up and move on.

I was excited to take a look at the Vyper team\u2019s perspective on contract design, but ultimately struggled to understand many of the design decisions.This post is meant as a friendly critique of what I found. Realizing that the language is still experimental, I hope it\u2019s helpful that I share my impressions sooner than later.First, I should say that although Python was my first language, I am muchstronger in JS and Solidity. So there may be \u2018pythonic\u2019 design elements which I misunderstand.Secondly, I will try to frame my comments with respect to the stated design goals for the language. They are very laudable goals, which are what initially attracted me to the language:Principles and goals1. Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.2. Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.3. Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code.I\u2019m particularly interested in the \u201cAuditability\u201d portion. Although the term is not explicitly defined, I believe an auditable language would include:explicit over implicit syntax (ie. function visibility must be declared, there is no default)low cognitive overhead to differentiate between types, and track state variablesThe code and my impressionsThe following is a toy contract I wrote, which is mostly a grab bag of functionality to see what I could get to compile. In order to communicate my likes and dislikes, it seemed easiest to just include it as comments in the code itself.I wrote whatever I was trying to do in square brackets, ie.[Declare a storage variable] followed by my comments on attempting to do that thing.

JozsefFollowFeb 28, 2018 \u00b7 7 min read[Note: I\u2019m working on Part 4, and sorry for the delay! I really appreciate the response this series is getting. As the topic of the next part is going to be the type system, I needed to do some extra research and some experiments. Also, Vyper is still in alpha, which means the language is chainging. Just recently I was part of a debate which changed the approach to handling types in arithmetic expressions.]This article is part of a series I\u2019m doing on the new Vyper language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. In the previous parts I talked about why I dislike Solidity, and about the core difference in philosophy between Solidity and Vyper. I suggest you give them a skim:Part 1 \u2014 Why I think Solidity is a catastrophePart 2 \u2014 On the philosophy of VyperSo after all this talk about why Vyper is needed and why it\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s get coding. We\u2019ll be implementing the Tribillium ERC-20 token, an absurd little token I invented for the purposes of tipping and gifting.Setting up the environmentThe easiest way to get into coding Vyper is via the on-line compiler at https://vyper.online/. Unfortunately, unlike Remix for Solidity, this is not a full-featured IDE with a test execution platform built in, just a regular compiler that will give you the bytecode and ABI of the contract.So to test our contracts, we\u2019ll have to use a local test blockchain. We could use ganache-cli (formerly known as testrpc), but it\u2019s a bit painful to do dev testing from the console, especially without the convenience layer of Truffle migrations\u2026 And while you can attach the Mist GUI to a ganache-cli instance, I\u2019m not a fan of Mist (to me it always seemed somewhat unstable)\u2026I suggest using the Parity client in private chain mode, as Parity has a very nice browser-based UI for deploying and interacting with accounts and smart contracts.To help you get going, I set up a Docker image you can use to kick off the environment. It\u2019s configured for development purposes, with single-signer Proof-of-Authority, some pre-funded accounts, a 5 second blocktime, 0 wei minimum gas price, and a block gas limit set at 7 million (slightly below the current annual moving average of mainnet Ethereum\u2019s block gas limit.)You can download the image source from my GitHub repo at the address https://github.com/daniel-jozsef/ParityPlayground. Please refer to the README.md there for instructions, I tried to make it as simple to get up and running as possible.Let\u2019s get codingSo I take it the test environment is up and running, you managed to log in with your browser, and you found the Vyper on-line compiler as well. Let\u2019s write some Vyper then.The first part of the Tribillium contract I\u2019d like to implement is the mapping for token balances, as well as the ability to buy Tribillium for Ether.Vyper is a subset of Python syntax, so if you\u2019re familiar with Python, you\u2019ll feel right at home. For those unfamiliar, in Python whitespace is a first class citizen, code blocks are delimited by indenting, and newlines hold meaning. Comments are prepended by the # sign.A Vyper contract is a lot simpler than a Solidity one: we have a single contract per file, no \u201cclass\u201d declarations. The suggested extension for Vyper is .vy, or alternatively, to enable Python syntax highlighting in GitHub, .v.py.Storage definitionSo let\u2019s create our contract, tribillium.v.py. The first thing we need to put in are the contract storage fields, in our case, the token balance mapping.balanceOf: public(wei_value[address])First, we give the name of the field (balanceOf), and after a colon, define the type. public() is a built-in that defines a field with a public getter function of the same name.Also, here you can see the syntax of defining mappings in Vyper. It\u2019s similar to an array definition, with the value type (in our case wei_value) first, followed by the key type (address) in square brackets. This is roughly* equivalent to mapping(address => uint256) in Solidity.(In case you\u2019re new to Ethereum programming: A mapping in Ethereum smart contracts acts as a key-value map, with log(n) read complexity. Uninitialized keys can be accessed, and have 0 / default values. Iterating over the key-value pairs of a mapping is not supported.)So let\u2019s do a quick detour to talk about Vyper integers. It\u2019s a lot more limited than Solidity, and I absolutely love it. There are two integer types: uint256 and int128. These types were recently renamed, and at the time of writing, the on-line compiler still knows them by their old names: respectively num256 and num.To be honest, the new names are a lot more descriptive, so I like the change. uint256 is for non-negative, and int128 for signed integers. That\u2019s it. Considering how in Solidity a byte costs the same gas as a uint256, this seems like a very good idea.As for wei_value, the name explains itself. *However, for some reason, currently it\u2019s represented as an int128, but sooner or later this behavior is subject to change, and will be a uint256 instead to keep with the \u201cde facto standard\u201d behavior on Ethereum contracts.Defining methodsVyper uses the Python syntax for defining contract methods, with some Ethereum-specific decorators available out of the box. (Vyper doesn\u2019t allow defining custom decorators, for auditability reasons.)@public@payabledef buy():  assert msg.value > 0  # We sell Tribillium at a rate of 1:1 to Ether  self.balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.valueThe msg object is similar to how we access it in Solidity, msg.value gives us the amount of Ether sent as part of the transaction, in wei. Its type is wei_value (see above for details.) In Pythonic fashion, the contract itself can be referred to from methods as self. Unlike Solidity, Vyper at the moment has a single assert statement as opposed to a separate assert and require. Also note its syntax, it takes a boolean expression without brackets.As for the decorators, @public publishes the method in the contract ABI (this means declared functions in Vyper default to being private), and allows external actors to call it, while @payable is similar to the payable modifier in Solidity, allowing the contract to receive Ether through this call.When someone calls this function sending a non-zero amount of Ether, they get an equivalent amount of Tribillium transferred to their balance.Deploy and testIt feels nice to see something run, so let\u2019s compile and try this out. First, hitting Compile in the on-line Vyper compiler will hopefully end with check marks next to the Bytecode, ABI and LLL tabs on the screen, like here:If you have an exclamation mark instead, you have probably mistyped something. Opening the Bytecode tab will show you the error message from the compiler.Now, to deploy our contracts on the test chain, let\u2019s go to the Contracts tab in the Parity UI, and hit Deploy. In the following dialog, you can choose an account to deploy the contract with (since the minimum gas price is 0, it doesn\u2019t have to hold Ether), and set a name for the contract.In the last two input fields, you need to copy the ABI and the bytecode from the respective tabs on the Vyper compiler. For smart contract newbies, the ABI defines the public interface the contract exposes, while the bytecode is the actual compiled program.Feel free to hit Create, and confirm the transaction with the account password (for the test accounts, it\u2019s the same as the account name). You\u2019ll soon have a card for the new contract displayed in the Parity UI.Let\u2019s attempt to buy some tokens then. Open the contract, and hit the Execute tab, which gives you a dialog for calling methods. Since there is only one method, buy() defined on the contract, that will be fine. Using an account that has Ether, let\u2019s send an amount of 3 ETH to the new contract.Once the transaction is mined, on the contract\u2019s tab, you should be able to query the balanceOf public field for the account that sent the Ether, and you should be seeing 3 Ether (or 3,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei) equivalent of tokens shown:Stay tunedSo far we\u2019ve compiled a very simple, but working Vyper smart contract, and deployed it to a local test blockchain. Next time I\u2019ll be digging deeper into the Vyper type system, talk a bit about safemath, the alpha status of the Vyper language, and add further functions to flesh out our token.See you!",

JozsefFollowFeb 21, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readSo, after a near month-long sabbatical at a Rainbow Family gathering, and getting all my t\u2019s crossed after coming back, I\u2019m back at writing this tutorial / introduction series to Vyper, the new, still-in-development smart contract language for Ethereum.On a sidenote, apparently, Viper was quietly renamed Vyper recently. From what I gather, the motivation was that source files could have the .vy extension, which rhymes nicely with .py\u2026 Sweet.In the last article, I explained why I think Vyper is a great idea to begin with, and the issues I have with Solidity as the de facto industry standard in the Ethereum space. Now we\u2019ll start looking at Vyper itself, and go through a demo project from inception to deployment on Ethereum.I decided on a tutorial project I\u2019ll follow through in this series. I published an article yesterday that I\u2019ve had lying around, about a fun little coin I designed. I have some OpenZeppelin-based Solidity code for it already written, but I decided it will be an ideal demo project for Vyper. It\u2019s complex enough to show the real world usability of the language, and non-critical enough so that the big \u201calpha\u201d tag isn\u2019t bothering me. :)So throughout this series, I\u2019m going to follow through the creation of the trickster cryptocurrency \u201cTribillium\u201d as described in the article linked above, solely in Vyper.Following alongThe latest documentation for Vyper can be found at readthedocs.io. Note how it\u2019s still spelled \u201cviper\u201d there. :) This name change is probably going to haunt link urls for some time. The source code for the compiler, and also the docs, live on Github at ethereum/vyper.Vyper also has an on-line IDE, similar to Remix for Solidity. Unlike Remix though, it doesn\u2019t support debugging (or anything beyond compiling) at the moment. Still, it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.Also, at the moment, the link displayed in the documentations (vyper.tools) is broken. The IDE can be accessed via viper.tools (yea, right?) or vyper.online.The controversial choices of VyperThe Github readme pretty much sums up the core driving motivations behind Vyper. Its aim was to avoid all the pitfalls Solidity fell into (or rather, dug for developers to fall into).Vyper is a highly security-focused language. It prioritizes auditability above every other conceivable thing. Coming from an off-chain developer background, it might look downright preposterous, but believe me, on the chain, it all makes absolutely perfect sense.Flat files ought to be enough for everybodyVyper can be defined in terms of what it doesn\u2019t have. And the most important thing it doesn\u2019t have is the \u201c2i\u2019s\u201d: includes and inheritance. You can also read that as \u201ccode composition\u201d.Vyper consciously and religiously forbids any form of code composition you\u2019ve probably taken for granted since the beginning of your life as a developer. Chances are, your first ever computer program started with #include or some idiomatic equivalent. So your panic is understandable and expected.However, before you storm out the door in indignation, or raise an issue on Vyper\u2019s Github, you need to understand that the constraints an Ethereum smart contract must operate under are close to those of a punchcard computer from the 70s.Code composition in Solidity gives you the illusion that you\u2019re developing for a modern machine, with modern constraints, ie. \u201cif it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d. Not on the blockchain it isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to write a contract whose installation cost exceeds the block gas limit. Using code composition makes it even easier.\u201cIf it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d? Not on the blockchain it isn\u2019t.So due to the limited resources, a smart contract should be as simple as possible. If you can shuttle logic off the chain while maintaining Integrity and Non-Repudiation (in my view the whole point of using blockchain at all), then do so by all means.If you can split your on-chain logic into multiple smaller contracts, then it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest that you do. Say, if you\u2019re running an ICO \u2014 but please don\u2019t run an ICO unless you\u2019re a crook \u2014 , it\u2019s better to have your ERC20 / ERC827 token in one contract, your crowdsale in another, your timelocked vestings in a third, etc\u2026As a rule of thumb, if your smart contract is so long and complex that a single flat file feels uncomfortable, you\u2019re doing something wrong (and it probably won\u2019t even fit on Ethereum in the first place.)Another reason for shunning code composition in smart contracts is the nature of smart contracts. While a smart contract is not actually a contract in a legal sense, on public Ethereum, a smart contract is a social contract between the owner and the users, and inbetween individual users. For it to be a social contract, it needs to be readable and understandable by those interested and doing their due diligence.Flat files make that easier, too.So what about code reuse?!Software engineers are, by nature, extremely lazy people. In fact, I have a pet theory that the less lazy a software engineer is, the shittier they are as an engineer / developer. A lazy person will notice early if they are doing something repetitive and pointless, and look for a better solution. A non-lazy one will soldier through, cementing in the bad initial decision that made the code complicated in the first place, and pollute the codebase with avoidable workarounds.So since we\u2019re lazy, we hate writing the same thing over and over. This is why we came up with includes, libraries, polymorphism, operator overload, generics, and all that stuff that makes up modern languages in the first place. So how does that figure with Vyper and smart contracts?When I thought of not being able to just include ERC20Token.sol, I felt this gut-wrenching cognitive dissonance sort of thing. Yea I want security and auditability, but shit, I\u2019ll actually have to press crtl+c and ctrl+v\u2026 \u201cGod, I think I\u2019m gonna wretch!\u201dWell, what helped me, and might help you, is to start viewing smart contracts as an entirely different thing. They aren\u2019t computer programs the way a webshop or notepad.exe is a computer program. They are self-documented, self-executing business workflows running on a distributed notarization system.When you are writing smart contract code, you are not simply coding. You are also documenting.The merits of templatingJust look at how a lawyer works. They are faced with the same issues, of having to churn out many extremely similar contracts, say for real estate purchases, employments, mortgages, corporate mergers, etc. One real estate sale is very similar to another. A lawyer who does real estate will have a real estate sale template that they can use to build a real estate sale contract for a client.Instead of composition, say hello to templating. Manual templating at first \u2014 as I said, if manual is too much work, it\u2019s probably flawed anyway \u2014 , but in the future I imagine we might see automated templating, too. Maybe with parallel documentation in human language.Also, templating simplifies things that would be complex in composition. Most bugs in OOP come from function overrides. When you want \u201cthis, but not quite this\u201d. With a template, you just go in and edit it. (And I already see someone saying that in OOP you often want multiple slightly different versions of the same, but as I pointed out, you don\u2019t have the capacity on the blockchain for something so complex anyway.)ConclusionVyper creators made some extremely brave decisions. Not brave like \u201cremoving the headphone jack from a mobile phone\u201d, more like \u201cremoving the steering wheel from a self-driving car\u201d. It\u2019s a demonstration of clear product focus, and a better definition and understanding of what it is we are even trying to accomplish.The Ethereum ecosystem needs Vyper and the vision it embodies like Apple needed Steve Jobs back in the 90s. In the follow-ups in this series, I\u2019ll demonstrate that despite its alpha status, it\u2019s already a much nicer language to work in than Solidity.(update: click here for Part 3)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Viper", "Vyper", "Solidity", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Is Vyper a good alternative to Solidity?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/is-vyper-a-good-alternative-to-solidity-ac89c33a1d43?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rachid Moulakhnif", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@blockchainerd", "publish_date": "2019-09-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-04", "readtime": "3.71", "claps": 124, "voters": 18, "content": "Is Vyper a good alternative to Solidity?Rachid MoulakhnifFollowSep 3 \u00b7 4 min readLet\u2019s see if Vyper is a viable alternative to Solidity and how much it\u2019s being used these days.What is Solidity?Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains( such as Ethereum Classic and Quorum ).If you already have some knowledge of JavaScript, Solidity\u2019s syntax will seem simpler than Vyper\u2019s (which resembles Python).Right now, Solidity main\u2019s advantage is its widespread use amongst Ethereum developers and the big amount of beginner resources there are lots of tools available to make your life easier like Truffle and OpenZeppelin. Also, Solidity courses are available online and some of them are even free. Have a look at CryptoZombies.What is Vyper ?What is Vyper?Vyper is a general-purpose, experimental programming language that compiles down to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode, as does Solidity. However, Vyper is designed to massively simplify the process in order to create easier-to-understand Smart Contracts that are more transparent for all parties involved, and have fewer points of entry for an attack.Vyper is a newer language, and its developers learned from Solidity\u2019s issues. They designed it to be more simple, secure, and easier to audit. As such, Vyper lacks modifiers, class inheritance, recursive calls, and a few other features that proved to be problematic in Solidity. Also, it adds overflow checking and strong typing.What is the most used, Solidity or Vyper?To compare which of them are most used, I used the GitHub search function to find how many contracts are written in Vyper and Solidity.What I have done is basically to search all files that have a file extension which ends either by .vy or by .sol since those are the respective file extensions of Vyper and Solidity.This search had a shocking result, as you can see by yourself: VyperVyper contractsSoliditySolidity contractsAt the time of writing only 160 contracts are written in Vyper against a whooping 311k contracts which are written in Solidity.The reason for a low amount of contracts in Vyper is because it\u2019s still an experimental language and even though it\u2019s going to be used for ETH2.0 the community and resources aren\u2019t there for beginners and the documentation is not as huge as the Solidity one.Is Vyper Turing complete as Solidity?First of all, let's head to what Turing complete means. A Turing Complete system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer (although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory).The Vyper language is NOT Turing complete, Solidity is. At the same time, a program written in Vyper will always have a predictable output. A program written in Solidity will not have a predictable output until and unless it is deployed and executed.Vyper is intentionally not Turing-complete for security and overflow checking reasons which are one of the biggest flaws in Solidity.So why should I switch to Vyper if the majority of developers use Solidity?Even though most of the contracts are written in Solidity as I\u2019ve outlined before, there are a lot of bonus points for Vyper and it\u2019s doing a great job improving the security of Smart Contracts.Striving for simplicity Vyper has eliminated class inheritance, function overloading, operator overloading, and recursion as none of these are technically necessary to create a Turing-complete language. Also eliminated as unnecessary are the less common constructs; modifiers, inline assembly and binary fixed point.Things to be aware of when coming from SoliditySince the documentation is not as big as the Solidity one which has been revised a lot of times, I recommend using this section of the documentation if you don\u2019t find what you are searching for.These are some of the things that developers who want to learn Vyper and already know solidity should be aware of:address(this) -> selfaddress(0) -> ZERO_ADDRESSNo reference variables in Vyperrequire -> assertassert -> assert .. UNREACHABLEIs Vyper going to replace Solidity?Vyper was NOT created to replace Solidity. It was created to be used alongside since it shares the same bytecode in order to boost security. A recent study found more than 3000 vulnerable contracts (written in Solidity)contain security flaws.Vyper was created to be as similar to Python as possible, but is not yet a start to finish replacement for either Python or Solidity, but rather a language to use when they need for the highest level of security is required. Smart Contracts holding patient health metadata for instance.Thoughts? Questions?

It is not yet ready to go mainstream since it\u2019s still under development. Vyper was not created to replace Solidity, but to be used alongside since it shares the same bytecode in order to boost security.Inspite of positive reviews pouring in for Vyper, some are questioning the need for another language to create smart contracts others are in agreement that security issues needed to be addressed.Vyper looks logically similar to Solidity but syntactically similar to Python. It eliminates many of the Object Oriented Programming paradigms and hence requiring a new paradigm definition for transactional programming. It has eliminated class inheritance, function overloading, operator overloading, and recursion as none of these are technically necessary to create a Turing-complete language.Should I learn Vyper instead of Solidity?The answer is quite complicated.Well If you want to be employed as soon as possible Solidity is the way to go. Currently, the most widely supported language out there for writing smart contracts is Solidity. It is currently the most documented and stable (um.. relatively) language out there. If you stumble upon something, there\u2019s a huge supportive community and resources that will get you up and running.If you\u2019re a person who is brave enough to experiment with a new language, and don\u2019t mind writing much simpler code, use Vyper. It\u2019s relatively new but it can create more auditable/secure smart contracts WITHOUT the features, community support and documentation that Solidity has.People who are pretty comfortable with Python will find the Vyper space better to breathe in. Vyper has a lot of features stripped down in order to enhance auditability. Smart contracts are supposed to be as simple and readable as possible, because these contracts can\u2019t change and minor flaws can spell financial disaster on a massive scale.Because of this, Vyper aims to provide the following features:Bounds and overflow checkingSupport for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidabilityStrong typingSmall and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functionsThe majority of the developers are speculating that Vyper is going to be used alongside Solidity in the future.When Vyper is ready, you will choose to use it or to use Solidity. Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for its future smart contracts. ( Confused? So am I. Ethereum still hasn\u2019t given any confirmation about the co-existence of Vyper and Solidity ). As far as the information flowing in as of now, Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for a majority of the the future smart contracts.Vyper is more on the positive side as far as security is concerned (Duh.) .It is more transparent for all parties involved, and have fewer points of entry for an attack. The existing smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks and contain security flaws. This is the fate of more than 3000 smart contracts as of now. Vyper has the potential to play an important role in the future and security of Ethereum.Keeping in mind the simplicity and security of this language, the following features have been omitted:Binary fixed pointRecursive CallingOperator OverloadingClass inheritanceInline AssemblyFunction OverloadingInfinite-length loopsModifiersYou want me to answer the question? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. At this point I don\u2019t think anybody knows. There\u2019s still a lot of time for Vyper to go live. Remember, the fittest always survive. Let\u2019s wait it out and see what Vyper has in store for us.If you wanna know more about Vyper, check out the official documentation here.Cheers :)This story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +432,678 people.Subscribe to receive our top stories here.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Smart Contracts", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Plasma MVP Implementation In Vyper", "post_link": "https://medium.com/layerx/plasma-mvp-implementation-in-vyper-5a3850e5b1b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ryuya Nakamura", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ryuyanakamura", "publish_date": "2018-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-25", "readtime": "6.89", "claps": 461, "voters": 23, "content": "Plasma MVP Implementation In VyperRyuya NakamuraFollowAug 24, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readMerkle Proof Membership Check in VyperRyuya Nakamura(@veryNR)and Osuke Sudo( @zoom_zoomzo) from LayerX R&D Team implemented Minimal Viable Plasma in Vyper, a smart contract language that targets the EVM.https://github.com/LayerXcom/plasma-mvp-vyperTo our best knowledge, this is the first Plasma implementation in Vyper. We hope this might be helpful for both Vyper and Plasma community.In this article, we show why and how we developed it step by step and what we learned from this project.ContentsOur motivation of this projectVyper\u2019s feturesWhat\u2019s Plasma MVP in Vyper like?Experience of development with VyperOur motivation of this projectVyper is a Python-like smart contract language that targets EVM. Vyper aims to be simple and human-readable as much as possible in order to improve the security of smart contracts.There have been a lot of malicious hacks due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts so far. Vyper is designed to prevent these vulnerabilities.Vyper\u2019s principles and goals in the document represents this well.Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Vyper is still under development but Vyper has a potential to be widely used when we taking these design goals and their importance into considering.We want to contribute to the Vyper community so decided to implement a Plasma MVP in Vyper. Plasma\u2019s contracts consists of various programs like signature verification, merkle proof, and priority queue so we thought this could be helpful for the development in Vyper in the future and Vyper\u2019s design decision.AcknowledgementWe implemented Plasma MVP based on OmiseGo\u2019s root chain contracts. We\u2019d like to express thanks to them and their \u201cgreat\u201d work.Special thanks to Jacques Wagener and Bryant Eisenbach, Vyper\u2019s core developers who helped us in Gitter many times.Vyper\u2019s featuresContract code in Vyper1 file = 1 contracts. There is no declaration like contract {\u2026}.Python-like grammar. Decorators like @payable, @private are used instead of modifers. Constructor is __init__(). Files in Vyper are similar to classes and you can access storage variables like self.myData and functions like self.myFunc().All variables must be typed explicitly in Python\u2019s type hinting\u2019s style.Order of definitions must be external contract interfaces -> events -> storage variables -> functionsA function can only call functions that are declared above it (that is, A can call B only if B appears earlier in the code than A does)Features not provided in VyperFollowing the principles and goals, Vyper does not provide the following features. (see the document for details and reasons)ModifiersClass inheritanceInline assemblyFunction overloadingOperator overloadingRecursive callingInfinite-length loopsBinary fixed pointWhat\u2019s Plasma MVP in Vyper like?Because of the features and restrictions of Vyper, the way we implement Plasma contracts in Vyper is really different from in Solidity.Differences due to Vyper\u2019s essential featuresWhat makes it different is the Vyper\u2019s features that follows the Vyper\u2019s principles and goals.(1) Use assert instead of user defined modifiersIn Vyper, you can\u2019t define your own modifiers for readability and auditability. For example, in order to limit the executor to the operator of the child chain, we use assert directly instead of using onlyOperator.assert msg.sender == self.operatorFYI, unlike Solidity which has require, assert and revert for exception handling, Vyper provides only assert. It\u2019s the same with require in Solidity.(2) No infinite-length loopSolidity provides while (condition) {\u2026} but Vyper doesn\u2019t. We can use for loop instead but the number of loop must be determined at compile time, which means range() only accepts literals. In our Plasma MVP, the upper bound of the number of loops are decided by fixed size priority queue. For example, the upper bound of number of loop in finalizeExits() is equal to the size of priority queue.# 1073741824 is 2^30, max size of priority queue is 2^30 - 1for i in range(1073741824):     if not exitable_at < as_unitless_number(block.timestamp):        break(3) Built-in secure operations and functionsIn Vyper, normal operators are made to prevent overflow so you don\u2019t need SafeMath library. Also, max(), slice() of byte array and RLP decoder are provided as built-in functions.(4) No inline assemblySolidity supports inline assembly. For example, a program which extracts r, s and v from child chain\u2019s tx signature can be written like:assembly {    r := mload(add(_sig, 32))    s := mload(add(_sig, 64))    v := byte(0, mload(add(_sig, 96)))}Vyper doesn\u2019t support inline assembly for readability and auditability. The program above is implemented with built-in function extract32() and slice().r: uint256 = extract32(_sig, 0, type=uint256)s: uint256 = extract32(_sig, 32, type=uint256)v: int128 = convert(slice(_sig, start=64, len=1), \"int128\")(5) OthersOnly integer literals are allowed in array access and arithmetic like exponent.Function arguments are immutable.Current Vyper\u2019s limitationIn Vyper, there are some proposed or discussed features without implementations or decided specification. In this development, we needed to handle these limitations, so we elaborated as below and we hope current limitations might be changed and we really would like to contribute to improvements :)Vyper don\u2019t have library system. We implemented all the functions in the same contract.A contract can\u2019t be imported from other file. The interface of priority_queue contract is written in root_chain contract.create_with_code_of() is used as a substitute for new in Solidity but with this function constructors aren\u2019t executed. We wrote setup() function instead and call it afterwards.Initial value can not be set in a declaration of storage variable so we set initial values in a constructor.Vyper don\u2019t have constant variables so we hard-coded in every occurrence with comments.Vyper don\u2019t have dynamically sized array. We used mappings with int128/uint256 key. Also, Vyper don\u2019t have dynamically sized byte array so we used fixed sized byte array with a appropriate size in the context or bytes[1024] as it\u2019s \u201cprobably more than you need\u201d.Vyper has struct type but don\u2019t provide defining new struct type like Solidity. There is a proposal about it.In private function, msg.sender returns the address of the contract itself. This is because Vyper use CALL opcode (not JUMP) in calling private functions currently in considering of the risk of side effects from memory access. This causes another significant problem that it requires more gas cost. (See discussion about it)And others. (Even private function can not return structs, strict handling of units, etc.)Experience of development with VyperDevelopment environmentVyper compiler is Python module and it is recommended to be installed in a virtual Python environment. (See the document)There are Vyper plugins for various editors. We used the one for vscode. (See the wiki about Vyper tools and resources.)Then, let\u2019s code and build it. There are two style about file extention, .vy and .v.py. We adopted the latter because truper (described later) only accepts .v.py.TestsWe used truffle for testing. Node.js module called truper compiles Vyper contracts to truffle compatible artifacts. Truper names artifacts like MyContract.vyper.json but truffle migration makes MyContract.json so the artifacts aren\u2019t overwritten. We wrote a npm run build script to compile contracts and rename them to have only .json.Vyper compiler does not create getter functions for public storage variables automatically. Getters required in tests must be defined explicitly.Because there is no Remix for Vyper ,we used truffle develop to see Vyper code behavior. vyper.online is a web app Vyper compiler. It\u2019s useful just to check a syntax can be compiled but it\u2019s not maintained well. (some relatively new features of Vyper can\u2019t be compiled.)Hard things(1) DebugDebugging Vyper programs is a little bit difficult. Truffle debugger doesn\u2019t work well with Vyper and there is no tool like sol-trace that tells in which line a error occurred.As a workround for now, we used console.log() in javascript test code and repeated commenting out some code and checking whether it raises error or not.There is a tool called vyper-debug but it\u2019s under development.(It raises error in pip install)(2) Deployment of RLP decoderBuilt-in RLPList() function is compiled to calling the contract which has the functions of RLP decoding. Therefore, you need to deploy the RLP decoder contract when you use RLPList() in your own ethereum network like truffle test in the following steps.Send 10 ** 17 wei to an account A (0x39ba083c30fCe59883775Fc729bBE1f9dE4DEe11) for a gas cost in step 2.Send a transaction signed by the account A which deploys a RLP decoder contract .In this way, the contract address of RLP decoder contract is fixed to the address hard-coded in Vyper compiler.We implemented a helper to do these steps. Please use it if you use RLPList() in truffle.TroubleshootingThere is less information about Vyper compared to Solidity and other programming languages so docs is the best source of information. However, docs is not explaining enough about some features and sometimes it doesn\u2019t reflect latest specification of Vyper.When we could not find the solution in the docs, we posted questions in Gitter. It\u2019s also helpful to see Vyper compiler. Vyper uses Lisp-like language(LLL) as intermediate representation so Vyper compiler is quite simple. For example, we found which type can be converted to which type with convert() function in the implementation of convert().Also, other implementation in Vyper is helpful.Vyper example repositorysharding1.0Casper FFGerc721-vyperUniswapContribution to VyperIn this project, we contributed to Vyper a little by fixing docs and proposing new features.In Vyper, proposals of new features is called VIP(Vyper Improvement Proposal).

Vyper is quite simple and easy to understand.For people familiar with Python, what you need to use Vyper is not to learn new syntaxes but to know Python syntaxes not allowed in Vyper.For now, documents and tools are not so abundunt but we expect Vyper to be widely used in the future.

It\u2019s written in a Pythonic way which appeals to me and as a more secure alternative to Solidity I think it has a lot of potential. I plan on writing more about working with Vyper in the future.Truffle \u2014 Too Much Of A Sweet Tooth?I\u2019ve recently finished working on a hackathon project and completed the 2018 ConsenSys Academy and during that time, for better or worse, I\u2019ve become pretty accustomed to using the Truffle development environment for writing code, testing and deploying\u2014 it just makes life easier.So, in an ideal world I\u2019d like to use Truffle for working with Vyper. After a bit of investigation I found this ERC721 Vyper implementation by Maurelian who did the work to make it Truffle compatible. I thought it might be useful to document the build process for use in other projects.How To \u2014 Vyper Development Using TruffleInstall VyperThe first step is to make sure Vyper is installed locally. If this has been done before you can skip \u2014 you can check by running the $ vyper -h command. There are various ways to install, including using PIP, the docs are here. I\u2019m using a Mac and did the following:Set up virtual environment:$ virtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvRemeber to activate the environmet:$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateThen in my working dir:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testInstall TruperNext I installed Truper, a tool written by Maurelian to compile Vyper contracts to Truffle compatible artifacts. It uses Vyper which is why we installed it previously. (See the next section for details of what it\u2019s doing). To install run:$ npm i -g truperCompiling, Testing, DeployingFrom your project dir (you can clone the ERC-721 project for a quick test).Run ganache test network:$ ganache-cliCompile any Solidity contracts as usual using:$ truffle compileCompile Vyper contracts using the command:$ truper* this must be called from the project dir and you must have the virtual environment you built Vyper in running.Truffle tests can be written and run the usual way, i.e.:Use artifacts in test files:const NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');Run tests using:$ truffle testTruffle migrations also work the usual way. For example I used the following migration file to deploy to ganache:2_deploy_contracts.jsconst NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');const TokenReceiverMockVyper = artifacts.require('NFTokenReceiverTestMock.vyper');module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(NFToken, [], []);  deployer.deploy(TokenReceiverMockVyper);};$ truffle migrateWhat\u2019s Going OnTruper uses Vyper which is why we installed it in the first step. If we look at https://github.com/maurelian/truper/blob/master/index.js we can see Truper is creating Truffle artifact files for each Vyper contract and writing them to the ./build/contracts folder of the project.Truffle Artifact FilesThese *.json files contain descriptions of their respective smart contracts. The description includes:Contract nameContract ABI (Application Binary Interface \u2014 a list of all the functions in the smart contracts along with their parameters and return values).

The good news is that now it is also open source (GNU General Public License v3.0)!What SmartCheck isSmartCheck is a static smart contract code security analyzer. It checks Solidity and Vyper code for vulnerabilities and bad practices. We use it in our audits and development and recommend to our clients, since it helps to detect many widespread flaws and increase code quality. Of course, we use other security tools, too, because there always are things that one tool detects and the other does not.We started building SmartCheck in spring 2017 and back then it was one of the first security tools for Solidity. Recently we added Vyper support, so now SmartCheck is the first and the only security tool that works directly with Vyper code (not considering EVM bytecode analyzers).ChangesIn the latest version of SmartCheck, the following upgrades were implemented:Vyper support addednew Solidity grammar usednew vulnerability search rules addedold rules improvedanalysis engine upgradedWhy open sourceWhy would users need SmartCheck source codes when the tool is available online?

This is NOT recommended for contracts where either full Solidity compatibility is not required, or no other compelling usage for using num256 over num exists. Notably, num256 is not overflow protected and may not support all the automatic security features of num as the language evolves. As the code of this token shows, the use of num256 over num also significantly complicates the contract code.THIS TOKEN HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION FUNDS. While the authors have made every effort to ensure the security of the supplied code, funds loss is always a possibility, and both Vyper\u2019s compiler and language remain nascent and rapidly evolving.SmartContractCode.vyVYPER IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, THIS CODE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION# Solidity-Compatible EIP20/ERC20 Token# Implements https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md# The use of the uint256 datatype as in this token is not# recommended, as it can pose security risks.# This token is intended as a proof of concept towards# language interoperability and not for production use.# Events issued by the contractTransfer: event({_from: indexed(address), _to: indexed(address), _value: uint256(wei)})Approval: event({_owner: indexed(address), _spender: indexed(address), _value: uint256(wei)})balances: uint256(wei)[address]allowances: (uint256(wei)[address])[address]num_issued: uint256(wei)@public@payabledef deposit():    _value: uint256(wei) = msg.value    _sender: address = msg.sender    self.balances[_sender] = self.balances[_sender] + _value    self.num_issued = self.num_issued + _value    # Fire deposit event as transfer from 0x0    log.Transfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, _sender, _value)@publicdef withdraw(_value : uint256(wei)) -> bool:    _sender: address = msg.sender    # Make sure sufficient funds are present, op will not underflow supply    # implicitly through overflow protection    self.balances[_sender] = self.balances[_sender] - _value    self.num_issued = self.num_issued - _value    send(_sender, _value)    # Fire withdraw event as transfer to 0x0    log.Transfer(_sender, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, _value)    return True@public@constantdef totalSupply() -> uint256(wei):    return self.num_issued@public@constantdef balanceOf(_owner : address) -> uint256(wei):    return self.balances[_owner]@publicdef transfer(_to : address, _value : uint256(wei)) -> bool:    _sender: address = msg.sender    # Make sure sufficient funds are present implicitly through overflow protection    self.balances[_sender] = self.balances[_sender] - _value    self.balances[_to] = self.balances[_to] + _value    # Fire transfer event    log.Transfer(_sender, _to, _value)    return True@publicdef transferFrom(_from : address, _to : address, _value : uint256(wei)) -> bool:    _sender: address = msg.sender    allowance: uint256(wei) = self.allowances[_from][_sender]    # Make sure sufficient funds/allowance are present implicitly through overflow protection    self.balances[_from] = self.balances[_from] - _value    self.balances[_to] = self.balances[_to] + _value    self.allowances[_from][_sender] = allowance - _value    # Fire transfer event    log.Transfer(_from, _to, _value)    return True@publicdef approve(_spender : address, _value : uint256(wei)) -> bool:    _sender: address = msg.sender    self.allowances[_sender][_spender] = _value    # Fire approval event    log.Approval(_sender, _spender, _value)    return True@public@constantdef allowance(_owner : address, _spender : address) -> uint256(wei):    return self.allowances[_owner][_spender]", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Vyper", "Programming", "Contract", "Erc20"]}, {"title": "SmartCheck \u2014 the First Vyper Security Tool", "post_link": "https://blog.smartdec.net/smartcheck-the-first-vyper-security-tool-a6a501904436?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kirill Gorshkov", "author_link": "https://blog.smartdec.net/@kirill1gorshkov", "publish_date": "2018-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-28", "readtime": "3.08", "claps": 192, "voters": 11, "content": "SmartCheck \u2014 the First Vyper Security ToolKirill GorshkovFollowOct 29, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readI tried to write some contracts on Vyper. However, it\u2019s toolbox is almost empty. Contract development and security checks are much harder than on Solidity. However, SmartCheck already works with Vyper. So, I decided to present Vyper and SmartCheck in this article.What is Vyper?New Ethereum feature is Vyper, a child of Python and Solidity. Thus, it looks like a contract-oriented Python that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine.It is syntactically similar to Python, so inherits simplicity and readability. It was done in order to make Vyper code maximally human-readable so that users with little prior experience could understand contracts.However, from Solidity Vyper inherits not so much. For example, there is no class inheritance or modifiers. Moreover, some Solidity features like assert() / require() / revert() are removed. The whole list of features can be found in the Vyper documentation. The main role of such changes is avoiding misleading code and improving security and gas consumption. Except these alterations, Vyper works like Solidity, as contract structure and built-in functions are the same. Moreover, EVM is the same too.So, if one works with Ethereum, it may seem to him/her, that it is a great possibility to start writing smart contracts without old problems. However, not everything is that good, as Vyper is still in beta version and just doing first steps. Thus, developers run short of tools for Vyper. One can check the whole list of tools and suddenly there are no security tools at all.Let\u2019s check securityMany Solidity developers know SmartCheck, but now it also scans Vyper contracts. You can upload your .vy files here and check it for vulnerabilities. Let\u2019s see how it works.We have created a short contract, which consists of three functions (constructor, fallback and logic function). This contract is a game where an investor can deposit money and double them if lucky_time is guessed or lose a half of them. Contracts code:investor_money: uint256[address]lucky_time: timestamp@publicdef __init__(_lucky_time: timestamp):    self.lucky_time = _lucky_time@publicdef __default__():    throw@public@payabledef add_investor(money: uint256):    if block.timestamp == self.lucky_time:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = 2 * money    else:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = money / 2All we need to do is to upload a file (smartcheck_test.vy on the screenshot).And submit it for a scan.Since it is a testing example, there are only four errors. Let\u2019s take a look at this vulnerabilities and understand what\u2019s a problem.Locked moneyContracts including at least one function with @payable decorator should implement a way to withdraw ETH, i.e. call send (recommended), raw_call, or selfdestruct function at least once. Otherwise, it will be impossible to withdraw ETH.Private state variableInitializing the variables without the public function defaults to a private declaration and thus only accessible to methods within the same contract. Contrary to a popular misconception, values of these variables are still accessible for users. Developers must account for the lack of privacy in Ethereum.Redundant default functionThe payment rejection default function is redundant, since it is generated automatically.Timestamp dependenceblock.timestamp variable is used in the contract. Miners have the ability to adjust block.timestamp slightly and thus manipulate the result of the game. It can be quite dangerous if smart contract\u2019s logic relies on the exact value of block.timestamp variable.Try it yourselfVyper can be found here, and SmartCheck is available online.

This also makes formal verification easier. Problematic features like inheritance, overloading and recursion are not included.

It is arguably true that all smart contract languages should be formally specified. The KVyper project is developing a formal specification for Vyper using the K Framework programming language design tools. Furthermore, the K Framework automatically generates conforming compilers from formal language specifications! Imagine formally verified smart contracts built with formally specified compilers. That is possible with Vyper.SupportThe Ethereum Foundation and many others organizations support Vyper. Vitalik Buterin and many other blockchain notables are fans of Vyper as well.ConclusionThe simplicity and security of Vyper may make it the right tool for many smart contract applications. Its agreeableness with formal methods is also promising. The smart design and wide support Vyper enjoys should continue to ensure a bright future.FeedbackFeel free to leave any comments or questions below.

To get you ready for the event (and because we\u2019re just too damn hyped to wait), we\u2019re sharing some insights from a few of our amazing speakers.Check out our latest Q&A with Jack Paxton, Co-Founder and CMO at Vyper and make sure to reserve your spot for his talk \u2014 you seriously don\u2019t wanna miss it.For folks who don\u2019t know, what is VYPER and why did you decide to start it?I started working in digital marketing agencies doing paid acquisition (Facebook ads, etc.), then progressed into overall acquisition and spotted a huge opportunity for a real growth hacking tool (my job was to acquire new customers and leads as cheaply as possible). I tested out the concepts with some agency clients then made the jump to starting VYPER with a buddy of mine once we saw the results.Can you share a couple examples of badass/unique/creative contests or giveaways that have been run on VYPER?Most of our contests disappear once the account is paused but here are a few examples:https://vyper.io/c/756http://vyper.io/c/719https://vyper.io/c/654http://vyper.io/c/1098What if I\u2019m an early-stage entrepreneur without resources or much money \u2014 how can I come up with content upgrades or giveaways?If you do not have an existing audience you can use contests to get going extremely cheaply. A common and simple option is to partner with a complimentary brand and give away their products. The other option is to purchase the prize yourself to then give away. It will be much cheaper than using paid media and much more time efficient than content marketing.My top recommendation here is to just really spend some time connecting with Facebook group admins, community leaders, and industry influencers to get them to share with their audience if you do not have your own. Here is an example of a beta test we did: http://vyper.io/blog/case-study-using-viral-leaderboard-contests/In terms of content upgrades, you can just repurpose blog posts, checklists or short e-book guides to use as PDF downloads. As people start sharing your blog posts to get the content upgrades, it will have a snowball effect to attracting new readers.What\u2019s the #1 thing entrepreneurs should know about growth hacking in 2017/2018?Email is still the best channel for owned traffic but it is getting harder to acquire these emails as consumers become more aware of marketing tactics.

Write my first article on medium2. Write a smart contract in Vyper3. Check the actual integration of Vyper in a Truffle environment.Let\u2019s start this day with Vyper!Why VyperBefore ask why Vyper, let us examine what is a Smart Contract. It\u2019s a Microservice with some functions to call in order to store and read stuffs in a decentralized environment? Yes of course It is. But from a non technical point of view a Smart Contract is a deal between a machine and the rest of the world. A deal to work in a certain way as long as the network lives.With this principles in mind a Smart Contract should be easy to write but must be easy to read.From the Doc:Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Simplicity first will mean that Vyper doesn\u2019t have: Modifiers, Class inheritance, Inline assembly, Function overloading, Operator overloading, Recursive calling, Infinite-length loops and Binary fixed point.Install VyperI\u2019m on MacOS, for different OS click here.Prerequisites:Install BrewInstall Python \u2265 3.6Install npmCheck if gmp leveldb are installed with Brew.Vyper is still in beta version, so we will install It in a virtual python environment.Virtual environment:$ sudo apt install virtualenv$ virtualenv -p python3.6 \u2014 no-site-packages ~/vyper-venv$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateVyper:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testProject SetupWe will use the init option of Truttle to scaffold our project.Fist we have to install Truffle:$ npm install -g truffleCreate and move to new folder:$ mkdir identity-test && cd identity-testInit the project:$ truffle initWrite Identity ContractThe project\u2019s purpose is to write a basic identity contract that represent who I am. My basic identity is made up by: name, surname and age, nothing more and nothing less than that.In contracts folder create a file named Identity.v.py ( yes we can use python syntax highlighter).Declare five public variables:owner is the owner\u2019s address that create the contractfirstname and surname are bytes32 representation of the name and surname.birth is a int128 represent a birth\u2019s timestamp. ( if I use negative timestamp \u2014 date before 1970 \u2014 , assert birth < block.timestamp revert my transaction, write in comment if you know why).creationTime timestamp represent the date when identity is created.Declare a creation Event:Constructor:We define:a public __init__ function that takes: firstname, surname and birth.we check that our function parameters are not empty ( N.B. assert not not _firstname is equal to assert _firstname != 0x000000000000000)we define our public variables.we log the Creation eventFirst name Update Function:Here we update firstname if: (i) is not empty, (ii) the transaction is from the owner and (iii) the new name is not equal to old one. At the end we return back new name.Fallback function:Fallback functions are triggered when the function signature does not match any of the available functions or when someone try to send ether to our contract.If someone try to send ether to our contract we send It back.Truffle IntegrationTruffle doesn\u2019t yet support Vyper contracts so we need some tool to compile Vyper to Truffle\u2019s compatible artifacts. Truper save us!Install Truper:$ npm install -g truperCreate a package file:$ npm initInto scripts field add the following scripts:\"scripts\": {  \"build:sol\": \"truffle compile\",  \"build:vyper\": \"truper\",  \"build\": \"npm run build:sol && npm run build:vyper\",  \"console\": \"truffle console\",  \"migrate:ganache\": \"truffle migrate --network ganache\",  \"migrate:mainnet\": \"truffle migrate --network mainnet\",  \"test\": \"truffle test\"},Now we can run the build task to build vyper and solidity contract into /build folder (N.B. remember to run It into virtualenv).$ npm run buildTestOne of the most interesting thing about our Truffle integration is that we can easily test our code.Create a new file Identity.test.js into test folder.Add momentjs and bluebird:$ npm install moment bluebirdNow we test our constructor function:In order to test our constuctor we have two main \u201cblocks\u201d:Fail Case: We test if contract creation fail (i) with an empty value and (ii) if we sand value in transaction.Success Case: We test if first name, surname, owner and birth have correct values. Notice we have to convert bytes32 in utf8 with web3.toUtf8() and bigNumber into string with toString(10)UpdateFistName test:Fail Case: We test if function fail with (i) transaction from a non owner address (ii) new name is empty and (iii) new name is equal to old name.Success Case: We test if new first name has new value.Fallback test:Fallback function send back transaction value excluding transaction fee, so we check the balance of the sender at the beginning and at the end of transaction.Now run $ npm run testDeploy To Main netNow we doploy our contract to the main net.

Foundation, in the fourth wave of its grants, lists Vyper development and Vyper auditing in its wishlist. That the foundation likes a particular language is usually a good enough reason for most developers to jump ship, but coders\u2019 struggles with Solidity \u2014 also championed by Ethereum \u2014 meant that Vyper had to work harder to endear itself to us. And it did!On the blockchain, where gas is dear and threats abound, there are really only two boxes that a smart contract needs to check to pass muster -It must be light and as simple as possibleIt must be secureEasier said than done.A freshly deployed loan contract, for instance, can guzzle up to 4 million in gas. Granted, we can take to recycling contracts to cut costs, but this is far from ideal. The security concerns with Solidity are another matter. It is a beloved language, painstakingly worked on by committed developers, but the toll, some would say, has been heavy. Over the last few years, a rash of attack vectors have been identified and the remedies have mostly been post facto, from the DAO onwards.Vyper is optimized, according to the GitHub page, for security, language and compiler simplicity, and auditability. We found we were in agreement with this. We began playing with Vyper to bolster ReloanR, a secondary market for DAI. It clicked and now we have decided to completely shift to Vyper as our primary smart contract language. For us, Vyper seems like a pragmatic way forward. It is a happy feeling to realize that Lendroid is among the first in the space to switch to Vyper, and we are thrilled about this journey.Here are some highlights so far.1. No more cross contract callsWhile most frameworks and their cousins move towards modular designs, Vyper can be fascinatingly monolithic. Counter-intuitive as it might seem, Vyper owes much of its robustness because of its monolithic architecture.Imagine a single contract that does everything \u2014 including loan kernel creation, fill, top up, position validation, cancel and close. It also takes care of filling in the token allowance at the outset.In effect, this does away with the need for cross-contract calls and all allied security implications. That\u2019s not all. The flow of the loan process becomes linear and logical when it\u2019s all bundled within a single contract.2. Minimizing unknown unknownsWe really don\u2019t know where an attack vector can pop up from, can we. The best we can do is to minimize vulnerabilities and Vyper is by far the most secure we\u2019ve seen. While we\u2019ll slowly modularize the architecture in subsequent versions, this monolithic framework seems the most secure right now.Fewer cross contract calls mean fewer attack vectors. An inherently lean style means a tighter code base and therefore, fewer attack vectors.Smart contract programming is not to be taken for granted, and the shift to a more air-tight environment in Vyper only makes sense.3. Faster, lighter, betterEfficiency has been a very welcome core feature of this language. Consider this. In the solidity version of ReloanR, a loan contract would require a healthy 1.7 million gas when deployed. This was still only half of what a loan process would guzzle in other lending protocols, but the level of consumption is hardly sustainable.With Vyper, a loan contract would consume around 800k or less in gas. That is a radical improvement in efficiency. And there\u2019s still a way to go. We believe the contract can be optimized much more and we shall do so, in subsequent updates.We have also been able to infuse a few nifty advantages to the contracts \u2014 like a locking mechanism, for instance. Say a loan is falling below the margin level. The wrangler is within his rights to liquidate it. But he can\u2019t; the loan position would be locked if the borrower chooses to top up the collateral. Cool, innit?As version 1 of the Protocol gets readyIn the two or three-year history of smart contracts, there has been so much progress, and so many risks and much uncertainty. Our aim has been to not just survive uncertainty, but to thrive in it. We see this shift to Vyper as a definitive step in that direction.We are and will remain a non-rent-seeking, open protocol. As we get the smart contract audited, feel free to have a look at the Vyper code here : https://github.com/lendroidproject/protocol.1.0/blob/master/contracts/protocol.v.pyOver the next few days, we will also release an updated version of ReloanR.

In order to accomplish that you\u2019ll need to create an interface:First, we define our ERC20Token interface. Notice we only have to include the functions we want to expose to our contract.Second, we establish a storage variable of type ERC20Token, so we can reference the external contract across our contract functions (I don\u2019t recommend this if you only need to call the external contract once).Finally, in our contract\u2019s constructor (or in any function), we can establish a reference to the external contract using the syntax ContractInterface(contract_address). We can now call the external contract\u2019s methods. In this example, we\u2019re calling the approve function of the ERC20Token contract, granting the Uniswap exchange approval to transfer our contract\u2019s tokens.If you also need to send value in your function call, see this post on how to send value in an external contract call.FYI, these code examples use vyper version: 0.1.0b10Happy coding!

However since her birth people keep finding problems in this coding language, and are asking for a better one. Vyper currently begins getting more spotlight.This document is by no means an in-depth comparison between the two contract coding languages in Ethereum. Rather, I try to take a sample application to make a practical comparison, and see the difference when the same logic is written into these two languages. After compilation, as long as the logic is correct, the contract deployment and interaction should be the same no matter which coding language is used. Therefore I walk through several test cases using the bytecode from Vyper-coded contract.Hope this serves as the first encounter for those who have not yet seen Vyper, and can arouse some of their interests to further explore on this new contract language in Ethereum world.Contract to be Built: Open AuctionThis is a very simple application. Open Auction assumes something to be sold publicly through auction, and anyone (with their Ethereum accounts) can bid it with their own ethers.When the contract is deployed, we need to specify two pieces of information:Beneficiary, who will collect the highest bid after the auction time is over. This is represented by an Ethereum address.Auction time (in second), which is the period for the auction. Bid is accepted when it is still in the auction period, and rejected when it is over. The bid is transferred to the beneficiary only after the auction period.During the auction time, the contract is open for bidding, and keeps track the highest bid and the bidder as its state variables. When it sees a bidder with a higher bid, the contract will refund the previous highest bid to the previous bidder, and keeps the new one. The contract simply rejects bid lower than the current highest bid.Note: it is by no means the best and the most optimized implementation of an auction contract. There is much discussion on how to make an auction contract better and more secure. This is just a minimal contract to demonstrate the basic operation for an auction.Note: this contract code is adapted from the example in Vyper (link) and from a video from Blockgeeks (link).Contract Code: Side-by-SideSimilar StructureThe structure of Solidity and Vyper is very similar, and can be easily divided into three parts,State variables: where one can define the variables for the contract. These variables are kept permanently in the storage trie of the deployed contract, and can only be updated through invoking contract functions.Constructor: the creation code that is executed once when the contract is deployed. It is used to initialize the state variables.Functions: one or more functions are being invoked through transactions after contract deployment. Once invoked, the code in the function is executed (on EVM) and the state variables and other states are updated accordingly.Here is how the logic is implemented using the two coding languages.Just a quick comparison between the two languages,The coding format of Solidity is JavaScript-like (arguably), while Vyper is obviously Python-based. See how to define constructor and functions, and how to refer a state with self.There are more data types defined in Vyper, such as timestamp, timedelta, wei_value, etc.Visibility (like public, private) and other keywords such as payable are coded as annotation in Vyper.Of course there are much more difference when comparing the code, but these are just what what we observe in these two contracts side by side.Compilation and DeploymentLike any coding languages in other domains, both Solidity and Vyper come with its own compiler. The objective of compilation is to generate two pieces of information for contract deployment: Application Binary Interface (ABI) and Bytecode.ABI: it is used when we interact with a deployed contract in a human way (application with SDK or command line)Bytecode: it is the machine code containing the instructions, and is being executed by EVM when deploying contract and invoking functions.The tools I am using for code compilation isRemix (http://remix.ethereum.org) the online tool for Ethereum contractVyper online (https://vyper.online) the online tool for vyper contract compilationBytecode truncated in both contractsWe will not do a byte-by-byte comparison between their ABI and bytecode, as we do not expect both are generating identical codes. We also will not draw a conclusion on bytecode size and therefore gas consumption, as currently we have only one contract without going into very detail analysis. Nevertheless, as far as we can achieve the same logic through executing functions, we just assume both are working fine.The deployment of bytecode is the same for both Solidity-coded contract and Vyper-coded contract. Remember, both bytecodes will deliver the same functionality and logic, and EVM does not care what coding language the bytecode is developed from.Testing with Ethereum Simulator and Geth ClientTo demonstrate the compiled result, we are going to deploy the contract. Here are the steps we are going to perform.As both yields the same result, here I just place captured screen shots for code in Vyper.My screen is split into two: the right-hand-side is the ganache-cli Ethereum simulator, and it comes with 10 Ethereum accounts, each of which has 100 ethers.The left-hand-side is where I deploy contract and interact with the deployed contract.Step 1First we define the variable abi and bytecode. Then use the command eth.contract().new to deploy the contract. Note that eth.accounts[9] is the beneficiary and the auction duration is 600 seconds (10 minutes).> eth.contract(abi).new(eth.accounts[9], 600, {from: eth.accounts[0], data: bytecode, gas: 1000000})We obtain the contract ID from the ganache-cli windows. Now we define an object openAuction to this deployed contract. We use openAuction to interact with this deployed contract.> var openAuction = eth.contract(abi).at(<contract address>)At the beginning we see the Auction Start and Stop time (in seconds). Date.now() gives us the current time (in milliseconds). It is smaller than the Auction Stop time, meaning that we are still in the auction period.Also we see the highest bid is currently zero, and no bidder submits the bid yet.Step 2Bidder eth.accounts[1] submits a bid with 10 ethers. The transaction is being processed. Now the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder reflects this bid. Note that eth.accounts[1] balance is ~90 ethers, which is 10 ethers less than the previous balance (plus some gas consumed for bidding transaction).Step 3Another bidder eth.accounts[2] submits a bid with 15 ethers. After transaction is executed, the Highest Bid and Higest Bidder reflects this new bid. As expected, 15 ethers are taken as bid from eth.accounts[2], while eth.accounts[1] gets back the fund as it is no longer the highest bid.Step 4Another bidder eth.accounts[3] tries to bid with a value 12 ethers, which is less than current highest bid (15 ethers). The result is a revert per our contract code (assertion). Meanwhile, the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder remain as Step 3.Step 5eth.accounts[0] tries to execute the endAuction() function, which calls for an end of auction. However it is again a revert as the auction time is not over yet. Current time is still less than the Auction Stop time.Step 6After the auction time is over (see current time is now larger than the Auction Stop time), eth.accounts[0] now can execute the endAuction() function. Per the code design, the state variables ended is now True, and the highest bid (15 ethers) is transferred to the beneficiary (eth.accounts[9]).Step 7After the auction time is over, if any account tries to submit a bid, revert happens as the bid is accepted only in the auction period (assertion).Step 8If anyone tries to execute endAuction() again, revert happens, as the whole auction has already ended.Closing and Further ReferenceThe structure of Vyper is almost the same as Solidity (and in fact all smart contract coding in other blockchain frameworks looks quite similar at all). Using Vyper\u2019s compiler we can get back both the ABI and bytecode, and deploy and interact with the contract with our normal way.If you are interested to know more about Vyper, there is a resource list in this site.

This can be a pain.I made a small library that ~~swerves~~ past this restriction. We\u2019ll discuss that in a moment. I\u2019ll briefly review Vyper before analyzing the library.Source: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bgBCdx65C6_w6XztyRXfYg.pngVyperis a language built to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum. According to Vitalik:Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)You can read the Vyper docs here and play with it in a Remix-like, in-browser environment here.The Becoming Future team loves Vyper for all the simplicity and security it provides. We hope to contribute more to the (admittedly, currently tiny) Vyper community in the future.LibraryLet\u2019s now dive into a simplified version of my implementation. Checkout and fork the repo here! I made implementations for dynamic arrays of different data types supported by Vyper. They all follow the same format, so if you understand one, you understand them all. We\u2019ll be focusing on a simplified version of the uint256 dynamic array implementation in this post.MAXVAL: constant(uint256) = 2**255ls: map(uint256, uint256)currMax: public(uint256)@public@constantdef get(_idx: uint256) -> uint256:    assert _idx < self.currMax    return self.ls[_idx]@public@constantdef length() -> uint256:    return self.currMax@publicdef set(_idx: uint256, _val: uint256):    self.ls[_idx] = _val@publicdef append(_val: uint256):    self.set(self.currMax, _val)    self.currMax += 1@publicdef detach():    assert self.currMax > 0    self.currMax -= 1@publicdef remove(_idx: uint256):    assert self.currMax > 0    assert self.currMax > _idx    i: uint256    for not_i in range(MAXVAL):        i = convert(not_i, uint256)        if i == self.currMax - 1:            self.currMax -= 1            return        elif i >= _idx and i < self.currMax - 1:            self.set(i, self.get(i + 1))Here\u2019s why this simple code is useful: Vyper only allows you to perform range() on a constant-sized input, which is problematic when one has a dynamic amount of content to loop over. Operations such as remove() would be impossible without a tiny fix. Simply define a different, mutable variable (in this case, self.currMax) and loop along range(MAX) until self.currMax is reached.That\u2019s it!I chose MAX to be the largest value a uint256 could be in Vyper, namely 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 just because I can. Clearly this destroys my space complexity, but at least all use cases are permitted. Feel free to alter this value to fit your own needs.I would not use the above implementation in production. I\u2019d use the actual implementation instead i.e. my library (found in the linked repo above and below and here). The actual implementation, my library, houses many security checks including whitelisted lists, which prevent a random person from accidentally or purposefully overriding your data.Checkout and fork the repo here!Analysis+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+|       Feature        |    Array    | Dynamic Array |  My Array |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+| Indexing             |     O(1)    |     O(1)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ start|     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ end  |     O(1)    | O(n) amortized|    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ mid  |     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Wasted space         |      0      |     O(n)      |    O(M)   |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+where M := 2^256 (but you can tune this to your liking)(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)(Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53939725/why-is-deletion-of-an-item-at-end-of-dynamic-array-on-time-complexity)Thanks for reading!

As the number of applications utilizingpublic cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms grow, thedemand for processing high transaction rates in the order ofhundreds and thousands of Tx/s is increasing.In this work, we present ZILLIQA \u2014 a new blockchain platformthat is designed to scale in transaction rates. As the number ofminers in ZILLIQA increases, its transaction rates are expected toincrease. At Ethereum\u2019s present network size of 30,000 miners,ZILLIQA would expect to process about a thousand times thetransaction rates of Ethereum. The cornerstone in ZILLIQA\u2019sdesign is the idea of sharding \u2014 dividing the mining networkinto smaller shards each capable of processing transactions inparallel.ZILLIQA further proposes an innovative special-purpose smartcontract language and execution environment that leverages theunderlying architecture to provide a large scale and highlyefficient computation platform. The smart contract language inZILLIQA follows a dataflow programming style which makes itideal for running large-scale computations that can be easilyparallelized.

If this isn\u2019t the case, then check out the online compiler or the (very early-stage) Twig framework to build your vyper contract. If you just want to play around with packaging any vyper contract, feel free to grab a sample vyper contract from here.getting setupClone the starter repo linked above, and follow the steps listed in the Quickstart section of the README.md to install the necessary tools on your machine. This repo is by no means necessary to package up your vyper contracts, but simply provided as a resource to make the manifest generation process as painless as possible.hello manifestWhat is a manifest? A manifest can be thought of as the basic unit of measurement in the EthPM infrastructure. Each manifest maps to a version of a package. When you \u201cpublish\u201d or \u201crelease\u201d a package version, you are simply storing the content-addressed URI at which the manifest is located on your on-chain registry.This starter repo uses some pytest-ethereum magic behind the scenes to help generate our manifest.If you\u2019re all set up, copy and paste your vyper contract(s) into the devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_contracts/ directory.If you want to customize your manifest name and version (which you probably do). Look for the \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udce6 in devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifest.py, everywhere you see those, you should fill in the respective data with your desired values. Full manifest customization is not currently supported (i.e. deployments, build_dependencies) but it\u2019s coming soon!Next simply run this command from your terminal.python devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifest.pyThis will automatically compile every vyper contract found in devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifests/ and add them to a manifest.You should see the following output.Your beautiful manifest<manifest_output>Manifest: <package_name> written to <file_path>There you go! You can got to the file path to check out your recently created manifest in all its splendorous glory.If you run into any problems or have any questions, hit us up on the EthPM gitter channel and we\u2019ll help you out of your jam.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Vyper Tutorial", "post_link": "https://medium.com/becoming-future/vyper-tutorial-d16b6f70f6b4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kenny Peluso", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kennypeluso", "publish_date": "2019-03-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-21", "readtime": "0.36", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vyper TutorialKenny PelusoFollowMar 21 \u00b7 1 min readAs a Vyper maximalist, I had to make a tutorial.by Kenny PelusoSource: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/vyper/master/logo/vyper-logo-transparent.svg?sanitize=trueMy tutorial on Vyper has been published on \u201clearnxinyminutes.\u201d It\u2019s aimed at intermediate and advanced programmers.

Try our free VyperSDKOne of the most significant challenges for researchers, security experts and those involved in cyber protection in the Windows environment is to know what is going on inside the operating system kernel. Because Microsoft has closed the possibility of monitoring the kernel with the PatchGuard, the only way to do that is with a virtualization layer.That\u2019s why we at Viral Security Group developed a thin hypervisor based on hardware-assisted virtualization technology. This thin hypervisor (called \u201cVyper\u201d) is the core engine of multiple applications, all of which have great potential for commercial use.The core engine was developed based on Intel VT-x technology which implements virtualization at the CPU level. In other words, the running operating system (e.g., Windows) is not aware of being virtualized.To enjoy the benefits of the engine, a dedicated VyperSDK has developed that includes the Kernel Hooking Library and the CPU Registers Monitoring Library. Both are running \u201con top\u201d of Vyper VMM and have the capability of controlling physical and virtual memory access. As well as monitoring for debugging configurations, and more.Such transparency to the operating system kernel protects against malicious code attempts trying to bypass existing security mechanisms in the Windows API.Vyper SandboxTo show what one can do with the VyperSDK, we developed a sandbox based on the virtualization layer. The Vyper Sandbox is an environment that allows one to check how malicious code behaves as soon as one activate it.Because the virtualization engine can monitor all operations performed on the operating system kernel, the report provided by the Vyper Sandbox grants the user with full transparency on the behavior of the malicious code.It is important to note that the current version of the Vyper Sandbox does not label which actions are legitimate or malicious. For this, the user must load known malicious code signatures and \u201cteach\u201d the sandbox how to tag the results.In other words, the Vyper Sandbox is a tool to record the behavior of malicious code running on the operating system. It\u2019s a sort of malware sniffer. Nevertheless, this is a unique ability. The Vyper Sandbox does not trigger the malicious code to run by injecting code. An action that can cause the malicious code to understand that it is being tested and, as a result, trigger evasive mechanisms.Instead, the Vyper Sandbox allows malicious code to run on a real operating system when the virtual layer runs between the operating system and the processor. In this way, the malicious program does not recognize that it is in a virtual environment and does not activate evasive mechanisms.The user\u2019s ability to view the full sequence of malicious code against the operating system kernel allows researchers, and developers of protection tools, complete transparency.Sharing with the communityAs security researchers, we know how to evaluate the benefit of sharing information. And hence, we give the Vyper Sandbox and the VyperSDK free of scharge to the community of developers and researchers. The goal is to share knowledge in favor of improving existing defense tools.However, we maintain transparency, and it is essential to know that the Vyper Sandbox is running in the cloud. Any malicious code snippet that comes up to the cloud for Vyper Sandbox testing visible to all users.Organizations or individuals who wish to receive the code for the Vyper Sandbox for local use may contact us on a specific application form.Each request will receive a response.

This document covers the design specification, providing references to the implementation along the way. Our code supports deploying a new chain to testnet, an on-chain registry of other plasma chains and their block explorers, and transacting via a command-line wallet.IntroductionThe vision of a network of blockchains as a scalability solution has been spreading rapidly. A multi-chain approach for parallelizing transactions is a promising way to increasing throughput\u2026 unfortunately, it also imposes significant challenges:We don\u2019t want to divide security, e.g. 100 chains with 1% of total security each.Advanced solutions like sharding are promising, but not yet ready.We need a solution to scalability that:Provides similar levels of security to the Ethereum mainnet, without paying millions of dollars in mining fees.Can be implemented on Ethereum as it exists today.We believe that the strongest candidate to meet these criteria is a network of chains, each secured to mainnet via the Plasma framework.Plasma is a family of protocols which allow individuals to easily deploy high-throughput, secure blockchains. A smart contract on Ethereum\u2019s main chain can ensure that users\u2019 funds are secure, even if the \u201cplasma chain\u201d acts fully maliciously. This eliminates the need for a trusted pegging mechanism like that of sidechains. Plasma chains are non-custodial, allowing the prioritization of scalability without sacrificing security.We envision a future with many Plasma chains, giving users choice over where they transact. So, along with releasing our plasma chain implementation, we have created a PlasmaRegistry.vy. The registry allows new chains to join the network by listing their IP/DNS address, a custom \u201cname\u201d string, and their contract address. The registry contract does the verifies trusted deployment, so users can be assured that any contract on that registry is safe to deposit into \u2014 even if its operator is malicious.Properties of our Plasma Chain ImplementationThis post specifies Plasma Group\u2019s current protocol and implementation, which draws from recent developments within the research community.Our specification has the following properties:Single transactions over large ranges of coins, solving the \u201cfixed-denomination\u201d problem in Plasma Cash.Block size which scales with the number of transactions, not the number of deposits.Light client proofs which scale in the logarithm of the block size and linear in blocks since deposit, making the operator the system\u2019s only (computational) bottleneck.A simplified, optimistic exit procedure that allows exits to specify only the most recent transaction, instead of both a transaction and its parent.Interchain atomic swaps, which lay the groundwork for decentralized exchange protocols.Unlimited deposit capacity.Our implementation follows the above specification, providing the following:A command line plasma chain operator written in Javascript.A plasma client implementation written in Javascript with a command-line wallet.A smart contract supporting ETH and ERC20 tokens written in Vyper.An integrated JSON RPC which allows clients to download and verify light client proofs and transact.A block explorer hosted by the plasma operator.A simulated client swarm which generates transactions to load test.A Plasma \u201cregistry\u201d contract which lists a set of verified-as-safe contracts and operator IP addresses for users to explore.If you\u2019re interested in checking out the protocol and the code implementation, you\u2019ve come to the right place!However, a few disclaimers before we dig in:Our plasma implementation is beta software currently only suitable for testnet use. There are surely critical bugs at this time.The main difference (explained below!) between this protocol and other Plasma implementations is the block structure: a Merkle sum tree. This has significant benefits, but adds complexity. Plasma is already complex in comparison to sidechains.Code has yet to be audited or formally verified, and has not undergone any optimization.While the operator is the only computational bottleneck, the primary performance limit today remains bandwidth. Custody proofs require downloads which are linear in the number of blocks. Our code is an improvement per block, but still linear. This active area of research is yet unready for implementation.Though our safety mechanisms and exit games are both implemented and tested, we have not yet built an automated guard service, meaning challenges and responses must be manually constructed.With that out of the way, let\u2019s jump in! The rest of this post will take comprehensive dive into our spec, where the code lives, and what it does.Table of ContentsGeneral Definitions and Data Structuresa. Coin ID Assignmentb.

General Definitions and Data StructuresThis section will cover terminology and intuitions for the protocol\u2019s components. These data structures are encoded and decoded by plasma-utils\u2019 library serialization. The exact byte-per-byte binary representations of all data structures for each structure can be found in schemas.Coin ID AssignmentThe base unit of any plasma asset is represented as a coin. Like in standard Plasma Cash, these coins are non-fungible, and we call the index of a coin its coinID, which is 16 bytes. They are assigned in order of deposit on a per-asset (ERC 20/ETH) basis. Notably, all assets in the chain share the same ID-space, even if they are different ERC20s or ETH. This means that transactions across all asset classes (which we refer to as the tokenType or token) share the same tree, providing maximum compression.We achieve this by having the first 4 bytes refer to the tokenTypeof a coin, and the next 12 represent all possible coins of that specific tokenType.For example: the 0th tokenType is always ETH, so the first ETH deposit will give spending rights for coin 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 to the depositer.The total coins received per deposit is precisely (amount of token deposited)/(minimum token denomination) many.For example: let\u2019s say that tokenType 1 is DAI, the coin denomination is 0.1 DAI, and the first depositer sends 0.5 DAI. That means its tokenType == 1, so the first depositer will recieve the coinIDs from 0x00000001000000000000000000000000 up to and including coin 0x00000001000000000000000000000004.coins all share the same ID-spaceDenominationsIn practice, denominations will be much lower than 0.1. Instead of storing denominations directly in the contract, it stores a decimalOffset mapping for each tokenType which represents the shift in decimal places between the amount of deposited ERC20 (or wei for ETH) and the number of received plasma coins. These calculations can be found in the depositERC20, depositETH, and finalizeExit functions in the smart contract//Note: decimalOfsets are hardcoded to 0 for this release, as we lack support in the client/operator code.2. Transactions over ranges of coinsTransfersA transaction consists of a specified block number and an array of Transfer objects, which describe the details of each range of the transaction. From the schema in plasma-utils (lengths in bytes):We can see that each Transfer in a Transaction specifies a tokenType, start, end, sender, and recipient.Typed and Untyped BoundsOne thing to note above is that the start and end values are not 16 bytes, as coinIDs are, but rather 12. This should make sense in the context of the above sections on deposits. To get the actual coinIDs described by the transfer, we concatenate the token field\u2019s 4 bytes to the left of start and end. We generally refer to the 12-byte versions as a transfer\u2019s untypedStart and untypedEnd, with the concatenated version being called typedStart and typedEnd. These values are also exposed by the serializer.Another note: in any transfer the corresponding coinIDs are defined with start inclusive and end exclusive. That is, the exact coinIDs transferred are [typedStart, typedEnd). For example, the first 100 ETH coins can be sent with a Transfer with transfer.token = 0, transfer.start = 0, and transfer.end = 100. The second 100 would have transfer.start = 100 and transfer.end = 200.Multisends and Transfer/Transaction AtomicityThe Transaction schema consists of a 4-byte block number (the transaction is only valid if included in that particular plasma block), and an array of Transfer objects. This means that a transaction can describe several transfers, which are either all atomically executed or not depending on the entire transaction\u2019s inclusion and validity. This will form the basis for both decentralized exchange and defragmentation in later releases.SerializationAs exemplified above, plasma-utils implements a custom serialization library for data structures. Both the JSON RPC and the smart contract use the byte arrays as encoded by the serializer.The encoding is quite simple, being the concatenation of each value fixed to the number of bytes defined by the schema.For encoding which involve variable-sized arrays, such as Transaction objects which contain 1 or more Transfers, a single byte precedes for the number of elements. Tests for the serialization library can be found here.Currently, we have schemas for the following objects:TransferUnsignedTransactionSignatureSignedTransactionTransferProofTransactionProof3. Block Structure SpecificationOne of the most important improvements Plasma Cash introduced was \u201clight proofs.\u201d Previously, plasma constructions required that users download the entire plasma chain to ensure safety of their funds. With Plasma Cash, they only have to download the branches of a Merkle tree relevant to their own funds.This was accomplished by introducing a new transaction validity condition: transactions of a particular coinID are only valid at the coinIDth leaf in the Merkle tree. Thus, it is sufficient to download just that branch to be confident no valid transaction exists for that coin. The problem with this scheme is that transactions are \u201cstuck\u201d at this denomination: if you want to transact multiple coins, you need multiple transactions, one at each leaf.Unfortunately, if we put the range-based transactions into branches of a regular Merkle tree, light proofs would become insecure. This is because having one branch does not guarantee that others don\u2019t intersect:Leaves 4 and 6 both describe transactions over the range (3,4). Having one branch DOES NOT guarantee that the other doesn\u2019t exist.With a regular Merkle tree, the only way to guarantee no other branches intersect is to download them all and check. But that\u2019s no longer a light proof!At the heart of our plasma implementation is a new block structure, and an accompanying new transaction validity condition, which allows us to get light proofs for range-based transactions. The block structure is called a Merkle sum tree, where next to each hash is a sum value.The new validity condition uses the sum values for a particular branch to compute a a start and end range. This calculation is specially crafted so that it is impossible for two branches\u2019 computed ranges to overlap. A transfer is only valid if its own range is within that range, so this gets us back our light clients!This section will specify the exact spec of the sum tree, what the range calculation actually is, and how we actually construct a tree which satisfies the range calculation. For a more detailed background and motivation on the research which led us to this spec, feel free check out this post.We have written two implementations of the plasma Merkle sum tree: one done in a database for the operator, and another in-memory for testing in plasma-utils.Sum Tree Node SpecificationEach node in the Merkle sum tree is 48 bytes, as follows:[32 byte hash][16 byte sum]It\u2019s not a coincidence that the sum\u2019s 16 bytes length is the same as a coinID!We have two helper properties, .hash and .sum, which pull out these two parts. For example, for somenode = 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, we havenode.hash == 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315 and node.sum == 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.Parent CalculationIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct a binary tree of hash nodes, up to a single root node. Specifying the sum tree format is a simple matter of defining the parent(left, right) calculation function which accepts the two siblings as arguments. For example, a regular Merkle sum tree has: parent = function (left, right) { return Sha3(left.concat(right)) } Where Sha3 is the hash function and concat appends the two values together.To create a Merkle sum tree, the parent function must also concatenate the result of an addition operation on its children\u2019s own .sum values:parent = function (left, right) {  return Sha3(left.concat(right)).concat(left.sum + right.sum) }For example, we might haveparent(0xabc\u20260001, 0xdef\u20260002) ===hash(0xabc\u20260001.concat(0xdef\u20260002)).concat(0001 + 0002) ===0x123\u20260003Note that the parent.hash is a commitment to each sibling.sum as well as the hashes: we hash the full 96 bytes of both.Calculating a Branch\u2019s RangeThe reason we use a Merkle sum tree is because it allows us to calculate a specific range which a branch describes, and be 100% confident that no other valid, overlapping branches exist.We calculate this range by adding up a leftSum and rightSum going up the branch. Initializing both to 0, at each parent calculation, if the inclusion proof specifies a sibling to the right, we take rightSum += right.sum, and if to the left, we add leftSum += left.sum.Then, the range the branch describes is [leftSum, root.sum \u2014 rightSum). See the following example:Merkle sum calculation for a branch.In this example, branch 6\u2019s valid range is [21+3, 36\u20135) == [24, 31). Notice that 31\u201324=7, which is the sum value for leaf 6! Similarly, branch 5\u2019s valid range is [21, 36-(7+5)) == [21, 24). Notice that its end is the same as branch 6\u2019s start!If you play around with it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s impossible to construct a Merkle sum tree with two different branches covering the same range. At some level of the tree, the sum would have to be broken! Go ahead, try to \u201ctrick\u201d leaf 5 or 6 by making another branch that intersects the range (4.5,6). Filling in only the ?s in grey boxes:You\u2019ll see it\u2019s always impossible at some level of the tree:This is how we get light clients. We call the branch range bounds the implicitStart and implicitEnd, because they are calculated \u201cimplicitly\u201d from the inclusion proof. We have a branch checker implemented in plasma-utils via calculateRootAndBounds() for testing and client-side proof checking:PG Plasma client-side sum tree branch checkeras well as in Vyper for the smart contract viaNote that the ranges are typed starts and ends, the full 16 bytes.Parsing Transfers as LeavesIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct the bottom layer of nodes by hashing the \u201cleaves\u201d:In our case, we want the leaves to be the transactions. So, the hashing is straightforward, but we still need a .sum value for the tree\u2019s bottom level.Given some txA with a single transferA, what should the sum value be? It turns out, not just transferA.end \u2014 transferA.start. The reason for this is that it screws up branches\u2019 ranges if the transfers are not touching. We need to \u201cpad\u201d the sum values to account for this gap, or the root.sum will be too small.Interestingly, this is a non-deterministic choice because you can pad either the node to the right or left of the gap. We\u2019ve chosen the following \u201cleft-aligned\u201d scheme for parsing leaves into blocks:Transfer sum parsingWe call the bottommost .sum value the parsedSum for that branch, and the TransferProof schema includes a .parsedSum value which is used to reconstruct the bottom node.Branch Validity and Implicit NoTxThus, the validity condition for a branch as checked by the smart contract is as follows: implicitStart <= transfer.typedStart < transfer.typedEnd <= implicitEnd . Note that, in the original design of the sum tree in \u201cPlasma Cashflow,\u201d some leaves were filled with a special \u201cNoTx\u201d transaction to represent that ranges were not transacted. With this format, the coins which are not transacted are simply those in the ranges [implicitStart, transfer.typedStart) and [transfer.typedEnd, implicitEnd). The smart contract guarantees that no coins in these ranges can be used in any challenge or response to an exit.Atomic MultisendsOften (to support transaction fees and exchange) transactions require multiple transfers to occur or not, atomically, to be valid. The effect is that a valid transaction needs to be included once for each of its .transfers \u2014 each with a valid sum in relation to that particular transfer.typedStart and .typedEnd. However, for each of these inclusions, it\u2019s still the hash of the full UnsignedTransaction \u2014 NOT the individual Transfer\u2014 that is parsed to the bottom .hash.5. Proof Structure and CheckingUnlike traditional blockchain systems, full plasma nodes don\u2019t store every single transaction, they only ever need to store information relevant to assets they own. This means that the sender has to prove to the recipient that the sender actually owns the given range. A complete proof contains all the information sufficient to guaranteed that, if the Ethereum chain itself does not fork, tokens are redeemable on the main chain.Proofs primarily consist of the inclusion and non-inclusion of transactions, which update the chain of custody for those coins. The inclusion roots must be checked against the block hashes submitted by the operator to the smart contract on the main chain. By tracing the chain of custody as verified in the proof scheme, from a token\u2019s initial deposit into the contract through to the present, ability to redeem is guaranteed.plasma-core follows a relatively simple methodology for verifying incoming transaction proofs. This section describes that methodology.Proof FormatHistory proofs consist of a set of deposit records and long list of relevant Transactions with corresponding TransctionProofs.plasma-utils exposes a static checkTransactionProof(transaction, transactionProof, root) method, which is used by plasma-core here via calls to the ProofService.Transaction ProofsA TransactionProof object contains all the necessary information to check the validity of a given Transaction. Namely, it is simply an array of TransferProof objects. As per the above section on atomic multisends, a given TransactionProof is valid if and only if all its TransferProofs are valid.Transfer ProofsTransferProofs contain all the necessary information required to recover the inclusion of a valid branch corresponding to the given Transfer in the Transaction at the correct block number. This constitutes:The actual nodes of the Merkle sum tree which represent the branch\u2019s full `inclusionProof`The index of the leaf to calculate the binary path traced by the branchThe parsed bottom .sum as described in the sum tree spec aboveThe signature for that particular sender.Right from the plasma-utils schema:Note that the inclusionProof is a variable-length array whose size depends on the depth of the tree.Proof StepsThe core of the verification process involves applying each proof element to the current \u201cverified\u201d state, starting with the deposit. If any proof element doesn\u2019t result in a valid state transition, we must reject the proof.The process for applying each proof element is intuitive; we simply apply the transactions at each block as the contract\u2019s custody rules dictate.Snapshot ObjectsThe way in which we keep track of historically owned ranges is called a snapshot.Quite simply, it represents the verified owner of a range at a block:{  typedStart: Number,  typedEnd: Number,  block: Number,  owner: address}Deposit recordsEvery received range has to come from a corresponding deposit.A deposit record consists of its token, start, end, depositer, and blockNumber.For each deposit record, the verifier must double-check with Ethereum to verify that the claimed deposit did indeed occur, and that no exits have happened in the meantime.If so, a verifiedSnapshots array is initialized to these deposits with each snapshot.owner being the depositer.Next, we apply all given TransactionProofs, updating verifiedSnapshots accordingly. For each transaction and corresponding transactionProof, the verifier performs the following steps:Verify that the given proof element is valid. If not, throw an error.For each transfer in the transaction, do the following: a. \u201cSplit\u201d any snapshots which were updated above at transfer.typedStart, transfer.typedEnd, implicitStart, and implicitEnd b. Increment the .block number for all resulting verifiedSnapshots which have a block equalling transaction.blockNumber \u2014 1 c. For each split snapshot which fell between transfer.start and transfer.end: i. verify that snapshot.owner === transfer.from. If not, throw an error. ii. set snapshot.owner = transfer.sender.The TransactionProofs must be applied in ascending blockNumber.Once this operation has been recursively applied for all TransactionProofs, the client may check for herself which new coins she now owns, by searching for all elements in verifiedSnapshots with a blockNumber equalling the current plasma block, and the owner equalling her address.TransactionProof ValidityThe transaction validity check in step 1. above is equivalent to checking the smart contract\u2019s validity condition. The basic validity check, based on the sum tree specification above, is as follows:1. Check that the transaction encoding is well-formed.2. For each transfer and corresponding transferProof: a. Check that the signature resolves to its transfer.sender address b. verify that the inclusionProof has a root equal to the root hash for that plasma block, with the binary path defined by the leafIndex c. calculate the implicitStart and implicitEnd of the branch, and verify that implicitStart <= transfer.start < transfer.end <= implicitEnd4. Contract and Exit GamesOf course, the proof for a chain of custody isn\u2019t useful unless it can also be passed to the main chain to keep funds secure. The mechanism which accepts proofs on-chain is the core of plasma\u2019s security model, and it is called the \u201cexit game.\u201dWhen a user wants to move their money off a plasma chain, they make an \u201cexit\u201d, which opens a dispute period. At the end of the dispute period, if there are no outstanding disputes, the money is sent from the plasma contract on the main chain to the exiter. During the dispute period, users may submit \u201cchallenges\u201d which claim the money being exited isn\u2019t rightfully owned by the person exiting. The proofs described above guarantee that a \u201cresponse\u201d to these challenges is always calculable.The goal of the exit game is to keep money secured, even in the case of a maximally adversarial operator. Particularly, there are three main attacks which we must mitigate:Data withholding: the operator may publish a root hash to the contract, but not tell anybody what the contents of the block are.Including a forged/invalid transaction: the operator may include a transaction in a block whose sender was not the previous recipient in the chain of custody.Censorship: after someone deposits their money, the operator may refuse to publish any transactions sending the money.In all of these cases, the challenge/response protocol of the exit game makes sure these behaviors do not allow theft, in at most 1 challenge followed by 1 response.Keeping track of deposits and exitsDeposits mappingEach time a new set of coins is deposited, the contract updates a mapping which each contain a deposit struct. From the contract:Note that this struct contains neither the untypedEnd or tokenType for the deposit. That\u2019s because the contract uses those values as the keys in a mapping of mappings. Accessing, for example, accessing the depositer of a given deposit looks like this: someDepositer: address = self.deposits[tokenType][untypedEnd].depositerThis choice saves a little gas, and also makes some of the code cleaner since we don\u2019t need to store any sort of deposit ID to reference a deposit.Exitable ranges mappingIn addition to adding self.deposits entries each time there\u2019s a deposit, the contract needs to somehow keep track of historical exits to prevent multiple exits on the same range. This is a little trickier because exits do not occur in order like deposits, and it would be expensive to search through a list of exits.Our contract implements a constant-sized solution, which instead stores a list of exitable ranges, updating the list as new exits occur. From the smart contract:Again, we use a double-nested mapping with keys tokenType and untypedEnd so that we may call self.exitable[tokenType][untpyedEnd].untypedStart to access the start of the range. Note that Vyper returns 0 for all unset mapping keys, so we need an isSet bool so that users may not \u201ctrick\u201d the contract by passing an unset exitableRange.The contract\u2019s self.exitable ranges are split and deleted based on successful calls to finalizeExit via a helper function called removeFromExitable. Note that exits on a previously exited range do not even need to be challenged; they will never pass the checkRangeExitable test called in finalizeExit. You can find that code here.Exit games\u2019 relationship to vanilla Plasma CashAt heart, the exit games in our spec are very similar to the original Plasma Cash design. Exits are initiated with calls to the functionbeginExit(tokenType: uint256, blockNumber: uint256, untypedStart: uint256, untypedEnd: uint256) -> uint256:To dispute an exit, all challenges specify a particular coinID called into question, and a Plasma Cash-style challenge game is carried out on that particular coin. Just a single coin needs to be proven invalid to cancel the entire exit.Both exits and the two types of respondable challenges are given an exitID and challengeID which are assigned in order via an incrementing challengeNonce and exitNonce.Blocknumber-specified transactionsIn the original Plasma Cash spec, the exiter is required to specify both the exited transaction and its previous \u201cparent\u201d transaction to prevent the \u201cin-flight\u201d attack where the operator delays including a valid transaction and inserts an invalid one in the block between.This poses a problem for our range-based schemes, because a transaction may have multiple parents. For example, if Alice sends (0, 50] to Carol, and Bob sends (50, 100] to Carol, Carol can now send (0, 100] to Dave. But, if Dave wants to exit that, both the (0, 50] and (50, 100] are parents.Though specifying multiple parents is definitely doable, this specification would be gas-expensive and seemed more complex to implement. So, we opted for the simpler alternative, in which each transaction specifies the `block` its senders intend for it to go in and is invalidated if included in a different block. This solves the in-flight attack and means the contract does not need a transaction\u2019s parents. For those interested in a formal writeup and safety proof for this scheme, it\u2019s worth giving this great post a look.Per-coin transaction validityAn unintuitive property of our exit games worth noting up front is that a certain transaction might be \u201cvalid\u201d for some of the coins in its range, but not on others.For example, imagine that Alice sends (0, 100] to Bob, who in turn sends (50, 100] to Carol. Carol does not need to verify that Alice was the rightful owner of the full (0, 100]. Carol only needs an assurance that Alice owned (50, 100] \u2014 the part of the custody chain which applies to her receipt. Though the transaction might in a sense be \u201cinvalid\u201d if Alice didn\u2019t own (0, 50], the smart contract does not care about that for the purposes of disputes around exits for the coins (50, 100]. So long as the received coins\u2019 ownership is verified, the rest of the transactions don\u2019t matter.This is a very important requirement to preserve the size of light client proofs. If Carol had to check the full (0, 100], she might also have to check an overlapping parent of (0, 10000], and then all of its parents, and so on. This \u201ccascading\u201d effect could massively increase the size of proofs if transactions were very interdependent.Note that this property also applies to atomic multisends which describe multiple ranges being swapped. If Alice trades 1 ETH for Bob\u2019s 1 DAI, it is Alice\u2019s responsibility to check that Bob owns the 1 Dai before signing. However, after, if Bob then sends the 1 ETH to Carol, Carol need not verify that Bob owned the 1 DAI, only that Alice owned the 1 ETH she sent to Bob. Alice incurred the risk, so Carol doesn\u2019t have to.From the standpoint of the smart contract, this property is a direct consequence of challenges always being submitted for a particular coinID within the exit.How the contract handles transaction checkingNote that, to be used in exit games at all, Transactions must pass the TransactionProof check described in the proofs section above(valid signatures, branch bounds, etc). This check is performed at the contract level in the functiondef checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer(   transactionEncoding: bytes[277],   transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],   transferIndex: int128 ) -> (   address, # transfer.to   address, # transfer.from   uint256, # transfer.start (typed)   uint256, # transfer.end (typed)   uint256 # transaction plasmaBlockNumber ):An important note here is the transferIndex argument. Remember, a transaction may contain multiple transfers, and must be included once in the tree for each transfer. However, since challenges refer to a specific coinID, only a single transfer will be relevant. So, challengers and responders gives a transferIndex \u2014 whichever of the transfers relates to the coin being disputed. The check decodes and checks all the TransferProofs in the TransactionProof, and then checks inclusion for each with the functiondef checkTransferProofAndGetTypedBounds( leafHash: bytes32, blockNum: uint256, transferProof: bytes[1749]) -> (uint256, uint256): # typedimplicitstart, typedimplicitEndOnce all TransferProofs are verified, the dispute-relevant values for the transferIndexth Transfer are returned to the exit game functions: namely the sender, recipient, typedStart, typedEnd, and plasmaBlockNumber.With that out of the way, we can specify the full set of challenge/response games for exits.Challenges which immediately cancel exitsTwo kinds of challenges immediately cancel exits: those on spent coins and those on exits before the deposit occurred.Spent coin challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that the exiter of a transaction already sent the coins to someone else.@publicdef challengeSpentCoin( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):It uses checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer and then checks the following:The challenged coinID lies within the specified exit.The challenged coinID lies within the typedStart and typedEnd of the transferIndexth element of transaction.transfers.The plasmaBlockNumber of the challenge is greater than that of the exit.The transfer.sender is the exiter.The introduction of atomic swaps does mean one thing: the spent coin challenge period must be strictly less than others, because of an edge case in which the operator withholds an atomic swap between two or more parties. In this case, those parties must exit their pre-swapped coins, forcing the operator to make a a spent coin challenge and reveal whether the swap was included or not. BUT, if we allowed the operator to do that at the last minute, it would make for be a race condition where the parties have no time to use the reveal to cancel other exits. Thus, the timeout is made shorter (1/2) than the regular challenge window, eliminating \u201clast-minute response\u201d attacks.Before deposit challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that an exit comes from an earlier plasmaBlockNumber than that coin was actually deposited for.@publicdef challengeBeforeDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):The contract looks up self.deposits[self.exits[exitID].tokenType][depositUntypedEnd].precedingPlasmaBlockNumber and checks that it is later than the exit\u2019s block number. If so, it cancels.Optimistic exits and inclusion challengesOur contract allows an exit to occur without doing any inclusion checks at all in the optimistic case. To allow this, any exit may be challenged directly via@publicdef challengeInclusion(exitID: uint256):To which the exiter must directly respond with either the transaction or deposit they are exiting from.@publicdef respondTransactionInclusion( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):...@publicdef respondDepositInclusion( challengeID: uint256, depositEnd: uint256):The second case allows users to get their money out if the operator censored all transactions after depositing.Both responses cancel the challenge if:The deposit or transaction was indeed at the exit\u2019s plasma block number.The depositer or recipient is indeed the exiter.The start and end of the exit were within the deposit or transfer\u2019s start and endInvalid History ChallengesThe most complex challenge-response game, for both vanilla Plasma Cash and this spec, is the case of history invalidity. This part of the protocol mitigates the attack in which the operator includes an forged \u201cinvalid\u201d transaction whose sender is not the previous recipient. The solution is called an invalid history challenge: because the rightful owner has not yet spent their coins, they attest to this and challenge: \u201coh yeah, that coin is yours? Well it was mine earlier, and you can\u2019t prove I ever spent it.\u201dBoth invalid history challenges and responses can be either deposits or transactions.ChallengingThere are two ways to challenge depending on the current rightful owner:@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithTransaction( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749]):and@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):These both call a@privatedef challengeInvalidHistory( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, claimant: address, typedStart: uint256, typedEnd: uint256, blockNumber: uint256):function which does the legwork of checking that the coinID is within the challenged exit, and that the blockNumber is earlier than the exit.Responding to invalid history challengesOf course, the invalid history challenge may be a grief, where really the challenger did spend their coin, and the chain of custody is indeed valid. We must allow this response. There are two kinds.The first is to respond with a transaction showing the challenger\u2019s spend:@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryTransaction( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):The smart contract then performs the following checks:The transferIndexth Transfer in the transactionEncoding covers the challenged coinID.The transferIndexth transfer.sender was indeed the claimant for that invalid history challenge.The transaction\u2019s plasma block number lies between the invalid history challenge and the exit.The other response is to show the challenge came before the coins were actually deposited \u2014 making the challenge invalid. This is similar to the challengeBeforeDeposit for exits themselves.@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryDeposit( challengeID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):In this case, there is no check on the sender being the challenge recipient, since the challenge was invalid. So the contract must simply check:The deposit covers the challenged coinID.The deposit\u2019s plasma block number lies between the challenge and the exit.If so, the exit is cancelled.This concludes the complete exit game specification. With these building blocks, funds can be kept safe even in the case of a maximally malicious plasma chain.6. The FuturePlasma Group is dedicated to the creation of an open plasma implementation for the greater Ethereum community. It\u2019s our mission to push layer 2 scaling forward by exploring the full potential of the plasma framework. There\u2019s certinaly much more to push forward! Here are some of the things we hope to work on next.Missing pieces in implementationAutomated GuardingWhile a good start, many improvements are needed to fulfill the true potential of Plasma, for this spec and beyond. Currently, the most glaring missing piece in our implementation is guarding, the automated process which submits challenges and responses on behalf of users. Thankfully, the exit games themselves are implemented and have been manually tested, so that client software can be updated after a chain is deployed. We felt this was sufficient for a testnet release, but is the most pressing addition the code needs.P2P History ProofsCurrently, when a user recieves a transaction, they ask the operator and re-download the full proof. This introduces a massive increase in operator overhead. What should really happen is that the sender directly transmits their locally stored proof to the recipient, bypassing the operator and making it much cheaper to run a plasma chain.Defragmentation StrategiesSince we support atomic swaps, our current spec is compatible with any defragmentation strategy without any upgrades to the contract. However, it remains to be seen what the right approach will be, especially since we require transactions to specify a Plasma block number. We hope the plasma community can build an extensible defragmentation abstraction library which allows operators and users to try out different approaches.Front-end wallet integrationWe have some designs for a front-end wallet, but currently the client only supports command-line transacting, with no support for trading different ERC20s. Having a nice UI to give to testnet users will be a major step up in terms of UX and accessibility.Operator feesBecause we support atomic multisends, we can support transaction fees without any protocol modifications. However, we\u2019ve not currently implemented anything for this testnet launch.Networked operatorSomething we\u2019re not taking advantage of yet is that merkle tree construction is highly parallelizable. If the operator was deployed as a networked cluster, we could increase block size by constructing subtrees in parallel.Raspberry plasma, anyone?Code reviewIt\u2019s very likely that all of the client, contract, and operator implementations have critical bugs at this time. We\u2019re hoping that part of this public launch will be an opportunity for external contributors to help point out many mistakes!Missing pieces in the specSuccinct Proof SchemesAs mentioned in the introduction, the most active area of Plasma research is a scheme to reduce the history proof size. P2P or not, an old (say, 1 year+) coin might have a significant amount of associated proof data, making transactions cumbersome. This is because the history proof contains, at minimum, one branch per block.RSA accumulator constructions and STARKS/SNARKS which batch branch proofs over many blocks are currently the most likely candidates. Both would require protocol changes: for RSA (which also introduces a trusted setup), an entirely new validity condition must be added to the exit game. For the latter, the tree needs to be constructed using a SNARK/STARK friendly hashing algorithm, which has not been implemented in EVM.Mass Exit/Deposit SchemesIf the operator does turn malicious, users must (eventually, no rush!) exit their funds. The concept of \u201cmass exits\u201d, in which many users consent to exiting together via a single on-chain transaction, would be a significant scalability increase. Ideally, the exit would be able to auto-deposit funds directly into a different plasma chain via a merkle root of balances. This would enable many users to switch chains, without individual balances ever being resolved on the main chain \u2014 a significant improvement in the \u201cnetworkability\u201d of multiple plasma chains.Multi-operator networksThough the operator cannot steal funds, they can censor transactions at will. One mitigation to this would be to replace the single-operator model with a set of operators, so that the existence of just a single honest operator is sufficient for clients to transact.Improved exit recordsOur exitable range construction allows for constant-sized checks on exited ranges. However, since each finalization updates this mapping, we will have a race condition if exits on the same range aren\u2019t processed in ascending order. This is because the first exit\u2019s finalization splits the range, changing the key to the self.exitable mapping and causing checkRangeExitable to fail for exits referencing the unsplit range. Those exits will revert and have to be re-submitted in the next Ethereum block. A gas-efficient alternative may exist, possibly using some sort of tree, queue, or some batchFinalizeExits method.State channels and scriptingRecently, there\u2019s been some great progress in the research community which suggests state channels and scripting with covenants are feasible on Plasma. Our current spec does not support either of these features, and will require a significant upgrade to the smart contract to support.Together, we\u2019ll build towards realizing the vision of a more decentralized future.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Plasma", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Reserve Protocol:

JozsefFollowJul 10, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readI\u2019ve fallen back a lot on my Vyper series. There are actually more than one reasons, including mental health, life management, relationships, work, schoolwork\u2026 But really, the part that will be interesting to you, the readers who have been waiting for the type system article for a quarter of a year, is the part about Vyper itself, and about Ethereum.Let\u2019s start with the Ethereum part, which is exciting but bad news. I\u2019ll cover the Vyper part, which is good news, in the actual next installment of the tutorial, which is actually coming soon.The great gas crisis of EthereumSo you might have heard of Gastoken. It has sent the Ethereum community into an uproar. While \u201ctokenizing gas\u201d sounds quite harmless at first, when you examine what it actually does, it will definitely start looking a lot more diabolical.The EVM has a relatively new feature that was meant to incentivize releasing unused Storage, and thus reduce the size of State. When you release Storage (by setting it to zero), you get some gas refunded. Enter gascoin. Gascoin is minted by spamming State with useless data, thus \u201cdeep freezing\u201d the gas paid for the operation \u2014 later, by setting these fields back to zero, users can thaw the gas. Well\u2026 you can guess whether the gas refund feature has thus made State smaller\u2026 or bigger.So\u2026 Enter the Ethereum developer community, and a revolutionary proposal to deal with Gastoken once and for all: rent, aka pay-to-stay. In the indefinite future, all Ethereum contracts will require regular rent payments, and contracts that fall behind on their rent will be evicted from State.Now, to ensure that value isn\u2019t destroyed by eviction, interested parties will be able to resuscitate evicted contracts by paying a fee. Now the deep specifics of this is not entirely worked out yet as far as I understand, I\u2019m pretty sure that resuscitating a contract with megabytes in Storage (ie. any sufficiently popular ERC20 token) will cost a pretty penny.So\u2026 this pretty much means that current Ethereum development practice, based on central registry contracts, is dead. ERC20 is dead. ENS is dead. Cryptokitties are\u2026 actually no, Cryptokitties aren\u2019t dead.Corporate, privately owned central registries, with a clear offchain owner who gets a cut of the money flowing through their DApp can of course keep working, as the owner will be able to take some of their profits, and pay the rent from it. It\u2019s decentralized, unowned registries, you know the kind that Ethereum was built to create, that will have issues.A question raised on Ethresear.ch was, after I argued the point above, was what technical shortcomings central registries have, beyond the rent issue. Well, the rent issue is the issue. Or rather, it\u2019s similar to CO2 emission taxes \u2014 it\u2019s not emission taxes that make hydrocarbon fuels unsustainable, it\u2019s global warming. Emission taxes are only a measure attempting to limit the issue.Central registry contracts are unsustainable because they rely on free access to a very limited resource \u2014 Ethereum State size \u2014 that is currently subsidized in an unsustainable way. Just leaving everything as it is is no longer an option. Not after Gascoin.You\u2019re in Limbo, you just don\u2019t know itNow, while I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come up with something to make sure the existing wealth that is tracked by Ethereum doesn\u2019t become unacessible, what this means is that any decentralized token, any truly decentralized contract that contains an address registry recording ownership, is pretty much a dead man walking.There IS a fix to save ERC20 (the interface, not the implementation), and in general the ability of Ethereum to do all the stuff we took for granted. Vitalik mentioned it in the Ethresear.ch thread linked above \u2014 a stateless central contract, and independent child contracts for each individual owner. With a central provenance check mechanism, this actually is viable!Too bad you cannot use it yet. You see, for this to really, nicely, seamlessly work, we\u2019ll need CREATE2. An EVM opcode that will allow the creation of child contracts with a custom nonce, as opposed to the TxCount of the parent. Thus, the creation nonce could be derived from the owner\u2019s address, making for a star schema of contracts implementing a \u201cmapping\u201d. The central, stateless contract can still expose the ERC20 interface, and users can still use it as they expect it to work.And CREATE2 doesn\u2019t exist yet. Now you can still build tokens that use a similar multi-contract structure, only one that uses random child contract addresses, and results in a UTXO-like user experience\u2026 But this isn\u2019t all that pretty either, as the EVM currently offers no access to a contract\u2019s own TxCount (which means additional Storage writes for keeping track, and an additional point of failure). Also, provenance checking in a contract is less than comfortable at the moment (maybe I\u2019ll do a separate article on that). For those curious, this is how you do it in Solidity, to my best knowledge:function childAddress(uint256 _nonce) public view returns (address){  //if(_nonce == 0x00) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x80))); // no 0 nonce on contracts  if(_nonce <= 0x7f) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd7), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x81), uint8(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd8), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x82), uint16(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd9), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x83), uint24(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xda), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x84), uint32(_nonce)));  revert(); // more than 2^32 nonces not realistic}So any contract you write with currently workable practices is unsustainable. Practices that would result in sustainable contracts are either unworkable or extremely uncomfortable (for the user too, not just for the developer). You\u2019re in limbo, you just didn\u2019t realize it yet.Well now you know.So what?I dunno. Lobby your local representative for the inclusion of CREATE2 in the next hardfork. It\u2019s pretty bad as it looks in my opinion, and people\u2019s total indifference in the face of impending doom is quite similar to how oil conglomerates treat global warming.We\u2019ll see. I think pay-to-stay, CREATE2, and a good, reliable and cheap way to do provenance checks will make Ethereum much better and more sustainable, and Ethereum contracts much prettier from an engineering standpoint. But that needs all of this implemented, and that doesn\u2019t change that none of this is implemented, and that doom is coming to Sarnath whether pay-to-stay becomes reality or not.ps. This is not an \u201cEthereum is dead, long live EOS / NEO / fuckcoin / whatever else\u201d shitpost. I\u2019m invested in Ethereum, both financially and personally. I love the vibrant dev community, the ethos of decentralization, the intellectual depth of development discussions. I\u2019m sure Ethereum will not only survive, but thrive. Great things are on the way. That said, there will be bumps along the road.

The implementation follows Lendroid\u2019s whitepaper, and some component properties have been added or updated for practical purposes. The source code is available on Github.Driven by designWriting smart contracts for crypto lending is as challenging as it is exciting. On the one hand, there are the functionalities that must be served by the contract. And on the other, the security of the smart contract. Then there is the third and arguably fundamental dimension of usability \u2014 how simple the contract is, how light, how economical when it comes to gas cost.Lendroid\u2019s design philosophy was informed by these challenges and can be explained in the following manner -Architect loosely-coupled smart contracts, where each contract is written to perform it\u2019s core functionality perfectly, and interaction of all the contracts resulted in realizing crypto lending. The functionality of each contract is limited to a maximum of two core functions, and cross-contract interaction is implemented via a registry contract.In effect, this design philosophy does three things -Makes the smart contract completely efficient in what it sets out to do.Keeps each of the smart contracts lightMakes cross-contract calls seamless and, more importantly, secure.Needless to say, each contract plays a very important role in the Lendroid Smart Contract ecosystem.Here are some instances -The Kernel contract is important in handling wholly and partially filled loan kernels.The SimpleWrangler contract validates a loan approval (signed from Wrangler server) to create a crypto loan.SimpleLoan contract is necessary to represent a loan position backed by the underlying collateral.Positions contract queries the ecosystem regarding lent and borrowed positions.The Lazarus contract was implemented to handle re-usable SimpleLoan contract for new loans.TokenTransferProxy contract is essential to facilitating token transfers across the contracts and protocol players.The Registry contract was central in storing and retrieving information about all contracts in the ecosystem. This is what makes cross-contract calls seamless.WorkflowHere\u2019s the broad workflow, with some additional detail to navigate unfamiliar components -Lendroid Protocol Smart Contract System design (Solidity)Kernel creation: A loan kernel / order is created, by either a lender or a borrower. If created by lender, it becomes a lend order. If a borrower creates the order, it\u2019s a borrow order. The kernel comprises the following components:lender: lender\u2019s ETH address if created by lender, else ZERO_ADDRESSborrower: borrower ETH address if created by borrower, else ZERO_ADDRESSloanTokenAddress: ETH address of token given as loancollateralTokenAddress: ETH address of token needed as collateralloanTokenAmountOffered: wei_value of loan token that would completely fill this kernel. Partial fills are possibleinterestRatePerDay: positive decimal valueloanDuration: seconds indicating how long a loan (created from wholly / partially filling this kernel) is validrelayerFee: Fee (in LST) paid to relayer for helping fill the corresponding kernelmonitoringFee : Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to ensure the loan is not defaultedrolloverFee : Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to roll the loan over / extend the loanclosureFee : Fee (LST) paid to borrower to clean up the loan contract, so it can be re-used for another loan.Off-chain storage: The loan kernel is saved to a central server, which then broadcasts it to relayersRelayer: On the relayer UI, a filler fills the kernel and sends it to the wrangler as a loan requestWrangler: A protocol keeper that approves and monitors loans. If the wrangler rejects the loan, he sends an error message which is displayed on the relayer UI.Otherwise, the wrangler appends a nonce to the request, signs the request, and then sends an approval object comprisingSignature,Loan amount filled,Kernel (loan terms in it), andNonceThis approval is then displayed on the relayer UI for the filler to confirm. After confirmation, it is sent to the protocol smart contracts.It first enters Kernel.sol smart contract via the fill() functionLoan approvalKernel.sol.fill(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates the kernel object (that the creator is in fact the one that created the kernel object). It then sends the approval to SimpleWrangler.solSimpleWrangler.sol.create(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, a loan contract is created as Loan.sol. Fees as described in the kernel are paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan amount is transferred to the borrower.Loan closure: Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.The Solidity Smart ContractsLow-level contractsThe following are the base contracts whose logic is not likely to change during the evolution of the Lendroid Protocol.Registry.solStores and retrieves addresses of the lower-level protocol contracts. It contains the following functions:setTokenTransferProxy()Sets the address of the TokenTransferProxy contractgetTokenTransferProxy()Returns the TokenTransferProxy contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setPosition()Sets the address of the Position contractgetPosition()Returns the Position contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setKernel()Sets the address of the Kernel contractgetKernel()Returns the Kernel contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setLazarus()Sets the address of the Lazarus contract (which saves Loan contracts for reuse)getLazarus()Returns the Lazarus contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.TokenTransferProxy.solInspired from 0xProject, all token allowances and transfers to and from the protocol are handled by this contract. This contract transfers tokens on behalf of all the contracts. It comprises the following functions:transferFrom()Calls into ERC20 Token contract, invoking transferFrom.Position.solMaintains a list of all lend and borrow positions per address. It consists of the following functions:recordLoan()Record a position whenever a loan is created. Lend position in created for lender, and Borrow position for borrowergetLoanCounts()Returns the number of lend and borrow positions for a given addressKernel.solExclusive to Kernel-related functionality. Handles kernel-fills and kernel-cancels. It consists of the following functions:fill()This is the entry point of the Loan creation process. This function is called by the relayer once wrangler approves a loan request.cancel()Sometimes, the kernel creator would want to cancel an unfilled / partially filled loan kernel. This function also helps to cancel a loan kernel created by mistake. This is an on-chain call, even though the kernel creation happens off-chain.getFilledOrCancelledLoanAmount()Helper function to determine the loanAmount of loanToken left in a previously created loan kernel.computeOfferHashFromFillInputs()Internal function that returns the kernel hash computed from inputs sent to fill(). Called by only the fill() function. This function was necessary to due to the Stack Too Deep issue.computeOfferHash()Internal function that computes and returns the kernel hash from inputs that make up the kernel object. Called by computeOfferHashFromFillInputs() and cancel() functions.Lazarus.solSaves Loan contracts for reuse, once they have been closed. This technique helps to recycle used contracts so they do not stagnate the Ethereum blockchain forever. This contracts consists of the following functions:addChild()Add a contract as a child. It\u2019s important that the caller is the owner of the contract. After calling this function, the caller should transfer the ownership of the child to LazarusreleaseChild()Release the last child and transfer it\u2019s ownership to the caller. Returns an array of [true, child address] is successful.cleanLastChild()Remove the last child if it\u2019s owner is not Lazarus. This is useful to clean up maliciously added contracts (since the addChild is a public function which can be called by anyone!)High-level contractsThe following contracts are likely to evolve over different versions of the Lendroid Protocol.SimpleWrangler.solCreates, stores info about, and manages loans approved by the wrangler. It comprises of the following functions:create()This function is called by the Kernel.sol contract (specifically, from Kernel.fill()). This function takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, either a new loan contract or an existing cleaned loan contract is reused, depending on whether a cleaned contract is available or not upon calling Lazarus.releaseChild() function. The Loan.init() method is then called to populate the contract with the loan terms. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan is transferred to the borrower.releaseContract()Transfer ownership of given loanAddress to Lazarus. This is called by the Borrower once a loan is closed. This function resets all parameters of the loan contract, and transfers its ownership to the Lazarus contract.SimpleLoan.solThe Loan contract containing loan terms between the lender and the borrower. All loan-related functions are performed by calling the following functions on this contract.init()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.create()). The loan terms are set as the contract parameters. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateralAmount of the collateralToken is transferred to the Loancontract. The loanAmount of loanToken is transferred to the borrower.computeHash()Returns a hash of loan terms defined in the contract.transferCollateralToken()Internal function to transfer the collateral from the contract to the intended recipient. Used by close() and liquidate() functions.close()Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.liquidate()Called by Wrangler if the borrower defaults his payments. In v1, we also allow lender to call this function if the loan expires and still has not been repaid.topUp()Borrower sends some more collateralToken to the Loan contract if the value of the collateral backing the loan decreases below the margin value due to market fluctuationclean()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.releaseContract()). This function resets all the parameters to their default values, and the contract\u2019s ownership is transferred to Lazarus. This makes the contract available for reuse. The borrower is then sent the closeFee in LST.renounceOwnership()This makes it impossible to transfer a Loan contract to a ZERO_ADDRESS, thus making it necessary to always have an owner.In conclusion \u2026The information above was intended to provide a comprehensive overview of our design philosophy while architecting our smart contracts.

Programming languages are designed to be fast to run, or easy to learn, or quick to write, or for lots of other reasons. One language can\u2019t do all those things well, so language designers make trade-offs. They may make a language fast but hard to read, or concise but hard to maintain. These goals and trade-offs are well understood and haven\u2019t really changed for decades.Until now.Now Vyper has given up a bunch of features in the pursuit of a new goal: to make it hard to lie.Vyper is designed for smart contracts which are\u2026 well\u2026 weird. We all know normal contracts, they\u2019re legal documents that outline the terms of a relationship. They\u2019re written, interpreted and debated by lawyers, judges and the legal system. \u201cSmart\u201d contracts are contracts that are written as computer programs and executed automatically on a blockchain. Smart contracts are a really exciting development and could be the start of a brand new era. Imagine a world without lawyers where the terms of a contract are defined, enforced and run as code. There is no interpretation or debate, just pure abstract unbiased code.Source: https://medium.com/@fabiojose/build-a-smart-contract-to-sell-goods-6cf73609d25But here\u2019s the problem: What if a smart contract has a loophole in the code? Or a bug?Well\u2026 you lose all your money and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.Without lawyers and courts and judges there\u2019s no debate, no recourse. It doesn\u2019t matter what the program was intended to do, it only matters what the program actually does. The program runs, you lose your money. End of story. This isn\u2019t theoretical, it has already happened. Like the time someone found a bug in an Etherium smart contract and stole $55 million dollars and was nothing happened to them.What makes this problem really bad is that writing tricky, buggy and misleading code isn\u2019t hard. In fact it\u2019s easy. In fact it\u2019s so easy that inexperienced software developers do it by accident all the time. Writing tricky buggy code is the default. Professional software developers spend most of their lives desperately fighting to write code that\u2019s easy to understand.Sometimes just for laughs developers will write hard to read code on purpose. Here is a flight simulator written in a way that\u2019s almost impossible for a person to read, and shaped like a plane just for fun.It\u2019s a flight simulator written to look like a plane http://blog.aerojockey.com/post/iocccsimSo what happens when someone hands you a smart contract shaped like a plane? What if you read the code and are \u201cpretty sure\u201d it\u2019s a plane? How sure do you have to be? Remember, if you\u2019re wrong, or miss a subtle loophole, you lose all your money with no recourse.Will Vyper make sure that if the code looks like a plane, it is a plane? Can it solve this core issue in smart contracts?In the end, like everything in the wild weird world of crypto currencies, Vyper and smart contracts leave me with so many mind blowing questions. In 20 years, will lawyers be replaced by programmers for at least some things? If smart contracts replace normal contracts, will lawyers learn to code? Or will we hire specialist programmers to review smart contracts? Will programmer lawyers try to trick each other with loophole filled smart contracts? Or will smart contracts find a new niche and not replace normal contracts at all? Could Vyper be the first loophole proof programming language?Regardless of what the future holds, I just love it when weird new things happen in technology, and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Programming"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nugamak/https-guarium-bounty-nu-5325-3975862-1520a856b469?source=search_post", "author_name": "AirDrop & Bounty", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nugamak", "publish_date": "2018-08-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-03", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "AirDrop & BountyFollowAug 3, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readhttps://guarium.bounty.nu/5325/3975862\ud83d\udd25GUARIUM AIRDROPNOT\u00c9 4.1/5 SUR ICOBENCH50\u201330000 GUAR (60$ \u2014 36000$)\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fAirdrop sous vyper avec plusieurs taches twitter, facebookhttps://t.me/airdrop_lux#airdrop #bounty #ico #\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0430 #\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u044b #freetokens #crypto #cryptocurrency", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/yacine-airdrop/brickexio-bounty-contest-f85fcc0cdc9f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Yacine Ajana", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ajanayacine77", "publish_date": "2018-09-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-26", "readtime": "0.12", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Yacine AjanaFollowSep 26, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readbrickexio bounty contesthttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vyper-assets/logo.b5cd7271904cbbdlogo22945.jpgYacine Ajana \u2014 MediumRead writing from Yacine Ajana on Medium.

Government is the tangible apparatus that legitimizes and executes laws. Governance is the means through which a government distributes its legitimization and execution across laws. Generalized governance (GG) is the set of rules all types of governance mechanisms follow. In other words, GG is all that can be abstracted from all forms of governance. In programming lingo, GG is a class, and things like democracy, republic, TCRs, etc. are instances of that class.Why do we want GG?GG is useful for the same reason every Ethereum Request for Comment (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721) is useful: Ease of interoperability is directly proportional with achieved network effects. When aspects of commonly used notions (e.g. what constitutes a token, what constitutes packets of information sent across the internet, what constitutes governance) are standardized and agreed upon, developers can concentrate on the core competencies of their products and thus augment the network\u2019s cumulative value (e.g. the nuances of TCP/IP minimally distract the front-end developer from providing their users with the best UX).What makes my GG so special?Past GG designs have assumed tokenomics-based solutions to governance (e.g. this GG paradigm is tokenomics-specific and this other GG paradigm, by Level K, is again tokenomics-specific but opinionated to easily accommodate TCRs), but clearly there are many instances of governance that don\u2019t need any tokenomics (e.g. despotism, direct democracy, and systems that cannot be implemented with tokenomics). Therefore, past solutions do not fully encapsulate the set of all governance solutions and thus are not truly GG solutions.I have formulated an alternative interface that I now propose as a true GG solution. This solution allows for data type-agnostic decisions and captures the governance instances born from tokenomics as well as the traditional solutions pictured above. I have also made and tested a basic, exemplary implementation of said interface. In this post, I\u2019ll be diving deep into how my interface operates through examining my basic implementation.How does my GG work?To explain how my GG works, I\u2019ll first list excerpts from the relevant code that can be referenced as the \u201clegal workflow\u201d is outlined. Then, I\u2019ll actually walk through said outline.Below are excerpts from interfaces/governance.vy, the interface for my GG:@publicaddPreferences(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _prefs: address) -> bool@publicaddIssue(_dud: address, _type: uint256) -> uint256@publicpropose(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _issue: uint256) -> uint256@publicdebate(_dud: address, _bill: uint256) -> uint256@publicvote(_dud: address, _debate: uint256, _votes: uint256, _ye: bool) -> uint256@publicresolve(_debate: uint256) -> bool@constant@publicnumIssues() -> uint256@constant@publicnumBills() -> uint256@constant@publicnumDebates() -> uint256These excerpts allude to the general workflow for \u201chow a bill becomes a law\u201d in my GG.Additionally, here is an excerpt from contracts/preferences_basic_address.vy, a necessary feature of the governance process:inDebate: public(bool)owner: public(address)delegation: public(address)opinions: map(uint256, address) # HERE@publicdef __init__(_owner: address):    self.owner = _owner@publicdef isInDebate(_status: bool) -> bool:    assert msg.sender == self.delegation    self.inDebate = _status    return _status@publicdef setDelegation(_gov: address) -> bool:    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.delegation = _gov    return True@publicdef setOpinion(_issue: uint256, _opinion: address) -> bool: # HERE    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.opinions[_issue] = _opinion    return True@public@constantdef getOpinion(_issue: uint256) -> address: # HERE    return self.opinions[_issue]In preferences contracts, user can input their opinion for various issues. Those opinions may become law. The excerpt above is taken from the preferences contract handling the address data type. Only 3 lines of code need to be altered to build preferences contracts listing opinions for different data types, and within those lines, only one word needs to be changed. The lines that need to be altered have been commented with # HERE in the excerpt above. If the governance system is to reach decisions regarding string[100] variables instead of address variables, then, within those 3 lines, simply replace address with string[100]. That\u2019s it. My repo provides examples of preferences contracts for uint256, string[100], address, and timedelta data types, so check it out if examples can explain this point better than I.With the necessary infrastructure in place, we can now dive into the \u201clegal workflow.\u201d The workflow that follows is how I thought about the GG process, but the governance interface, I think, accommodates a plethora of alternative and valid workflows. Those other workflows may not even include preferences contracts! That being said, here is my envisioned workflow:Future members deploy preferences contracts for every data type of decision.Future members set their preferences i.e. their opinions are recorded and setOpinion() is called.The GG contract is deployedMembers are \u201cadded\u201d i.e. Members must call setDelegation() to assign the GG contract as their preferences\u2019 delegation, addPreferences() is called to link their preferences with their address the GG contract, and some other operation may be invoked within GG (e.g. reputation points may be assigned to the member\u2019s address or some access token may be assigned to them).5. Members call propose() to propose that their opinion on an issue becomes law.6. Debates on proposed bills are initiated by calling debate().7. Votes follow via calling vote().8. A debate is resolved by calling resolve().9. The governing body\u2019s legitimization of an opinion is asserted; A bill becomes a law. The actual read operation of laws involves reading the approved bill\u2019s sponsor\u2019s preferences and then reading the sponsor\u2019s opinion.A locking operation can be applied to the preferences contract such that when one\u2019s opinion becomes law, then they cannot change their opinion on an issue. The basic implementation on my repo works differently in that it allows those whose opinions have been deemed as law to change their opinions and thus the law. This is akin to selecting \u201can expert\u201d per issue governed, where the governing body defaults to the expertise of a subset of members. I say \u201csubset\u201d because a preferences contract\u2019s opinions can easily be governed by another governing body of individuals, another GG contract, or even the same GG contract with opinionated functionality for whitelisted committees.ConclusionThe contract in my repo has a basic implementations of both the preferences and GG contracts.

JozsefFollowDec 12, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readWell, after some time spent coding Solidity, and designing off-chain supporting infrastructure for all the things we\u2019ve been coding in Solidity, I\u2019ve come to truly despise this ubiquitous little dialect.Note that this is the opposite of what usually happens.In my .NET developer days, I was severely prejudiced against JavaScript, which, after a month or two spent with Node.js, I actually grew to love more than I ever liked C#. (Truth be told, my heart lies with ES6 \u2014 async/await is a gift from heaven, truly, but still.)I saw Python as a useless kids\u2019 language, a contemporary heir to Commodore Basic and its ilk, until I started using Python\u2026 Which is when I really \u201cgot it\u201d, and learned to actually like its simplicity, its cute \u201cpythonic\u201d nature.Solidity however? Well, at first I thought it was great, I mean it\u2019s the language of Ethereum, and Ethereum is the definition of awesome, right? Well, add a few months, and I cannot express in words how much I loathe this language. What\u2019s with this type system?! Who on Earth ever thought that this was a good idea?Honestly, it\u2019s kinda like Japanese script. A square peg of immense proportions hammered into a round hole with great abandon, breaking peg and hole alike, and then the rough edges filed off, badly. (No offense to any Japanese readers, but seriously, your script system is the oldest and greatest example on Earth of technical debt running wild.)And sure, break Ethereum it did. Multiple times. Last time, in the fabulous \u201cI accidentally killed it\u201d incident. Also, in the process, what started out as a subset of Javascript syntax became something completely different, and not in a good way.At first I was so glad that Solidity has all these include and inheritance features. Seemed incredibly useful\u2026 However, I soon found that installing a program you\u2019d consider of moderate size in the off-chain world will easily exceed the block gas limit. So why do we need inheritance, again?After an initial and misguided period of actually using inheritance (and getting burned by human mistakes and compiler bugs alike), I have fallen back on an Interfaces + Code model. Interfaces are there to enforce public interfaces. Code is there to describe behavior. One contract, one code file. That\u2019s it.That makes Solidity slightly less unseemly, but does nothing to fix the deeply broken type system, which the real bogeyman is. So where can we turn? Fortunately, a newer, better, cleaner Ethereum contract language is in development, called Viper. Unlike Solidity, it\u2019s actually coming from the source (Vitalik), and is based on Python.Even though it\u2019s still in alpha, I found it incredibly likable at first sight. For one, there is no code reuse built into the language. No includes, no inheritance. That might sound bad at first, but not if you consider the specifics of the platform you\u2019re developing on. Also, the type system looks pretty simple and a lot better thought through than the one in Solidity.I intend to write a few posts about exploring this new language, and getting familiar with its quirks and gotchas.

JozsefFollowMar 10, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSolidity became such a hit phenomenon specifically because it makes people believe they can code Ethereum. After all, a smart contract isn\u2019t that complex (it cannot be too complex, given the platform limitations)\u2026 but then, this is coupled with a language structure that is far from obvious (did you even know Solidity had pointers, and even worse, pointer arithmetic?), and a million plus one ways to mess up.Solidity is overly complicated, full of traps that lead to insecure code, or can be exploited to write intentionally insecure, backdoored code. It doesn\u2019t present idiomatic guidelines for code, it provides dozens of ways to solve the same simplistic task over and over, it does nothing to guide the developer\u2019s hand, or even make them aware of what they are in the process of doing.I\u2019m doing a series on Vyper, the new Ethereum language, which is a gigantic leap ahead compared to Solidity, but as a general-purposed language, I still think using it should be the exception, not the norm. 90% of smart contracts on Ethereum are either (1) tokens, or (2) value stores with various locking mechanisms. There is no reason whatsoever to re-implement these in generic languages over and over.The way this is done by others is using domain-specific languages. Chain, probably one of the most influential players in our space, has developed Ivy \u2014 a domain-specific language for the exact two use cases mentioned above. Bitcoin is getting an Ivy compiler. So I wonder, if Bitcoin has one, why don\u2019t we have one?I was talking to a Hyperledger guy recently, and it felt like I was back in the 90s, talking to a mainframe guy who\u2019s only interested in \u201creal computers\u201d, none of these pissant PCs\u2026 Well, it turns out, his main problem with Ethereum was none other than Solidity. And I couldn\u2019t agree with him more. If I was doing systems design for a bank, would I consider Solidity as a language I want in our stack? Fuck no. Seriously. No.And what other options do you have if you\u2019re working on Ethereum? (And why wouldn\u2019t you want to work on Ethereum? Ethereum as an infrastructure is really well-built, and there\u2019s an immense amount of R&D going into it.) Well, it turns out, there aren\u2019t a lot of production-ready, well-maintained languages to begin with, but also we have a problem with ecosystem lock-in.I still remember the ubiquitiously hated little \u201cDesigned for Windows 95\u201d badge. It was on everything from games to floppy disk cases. Well, we now its equally hateful equivalent. Truffle? Designed for Solidity. Ganache? Designed for Solidity. Remix? Designed for fucking Solidity. Using any other language forces you to abandon the existing tooling, and go pedestrian. Sure, it\u2019s not a whole lot of tooling to begin with, and last time I checked, the debugger was completely useless, but it still pisses me off.Leave the EVM alone!!!Seriously. It\u2019s not its fault. Ethereum was designed with simplicity in mind. The EVM is almost as simple as a textbook Turing machine. Actually, it\u2019s simpler. It\u2019s the bare minimum of what you can call a processor, real or virtual.So when new blockchain projects spring up trying to fix Solidity\u2019s issues by replacing the EVM, I can\u2019t help but feel a certain way. Would it be cool if EVM bytecode was more transparent to static analysis? Sure, but in an open source ecosystem it wouldn\u2019t be a killer feature, if\u2026the high level language the contract was written in was transparent to static analysis, andthe compiler was formally audited for correctness (ie. the semantics of the output matches the input.)The EVM and its simplicity and generality are a feature of Ethereum, not a bug. The bug is that people are using literally the world\u2019s crappiest, most amateurish language ever for coding security-critical applications on it.The power and limits of going domain-specificNow I\u2019m not saying that ditching multi-purpose languages is a goal. While I cannot see Solidity with anything but contempt, Vyper is quite cool, and for very specific tasks I see value in using LLL time to time. The weakness of Ethereum is also one of its strengths, a multi-purpose language allows for anything and everything to be developed. (Which is also why I argue for keeping the EVM itself.)Ivy, being domain-specific, by its nature constricts its uses to a specific domain (tokenized value and transactions with it). It\u2019s beautifully focused and fully declarative, built on verify, unlock and lock statements.It allows for the verification of credentials and business rules, the conditional unlocking of value based on these verifications, and the locking of value for the recipient. Instead of having to implement balance handling for the n+1th time, you can actually focus on what makes your stuff different.In Ethereum, the concept of Libraries tried to solve the issue of having to implement basic functionality again and again. It failed so spectacularly and catastrophically (due to no specific fault of the concept, but design faults of Solidity, and the horrid implementation of the Solidity Library pattern itself), that today it\u2019s barely ever used, and raises major flags with auditors and clients when it is.Domain specific languages, and declarative languages generally need an underlying infrastructure written in more general, and typically imperative languages. Prolog/CLP solvers tends to be written in C++. So Ivy, or other domain specific languages on Ethereum won\u2019t be the be-all-end-all of Ethereum programming.The infrastructure that will allow DApp developers to use these high-level and high-reliability tools will need some form of the Library concept. However, that underlyning infrastructure will need to be rock solid and secure\u2014 Parity multisig wallets have taught us at least this much.

For example, when the app loaded \u2014 front and center on the screen \u2014 in the editor \u2014 was `Ballot.sol` \u2014 which is rather cryptic for beginners. Because Remix is a landing page for new users to smart contract programming, we needed to improve their first impression.We don\u2019t want to limit the development of Remix to what our team can produce. We think it is a lot more valuable for the community to build a plugin framework where any team can create its own plugin for Remix. This means, that YOU can build a plugin for Remix to extend its functionality in a direction that you\u2019d like.We started to build something in that direction last year. Now it\u2019s time to make it a powerful framework (GrandSchtroumpf is the main developer of the remix-plugin infrastructure) and things are moving nicely!The basic functionalities are now in place and more will come soon.Every feature is now loaded as plugin and displayed either in the side panel for plugins suited to vertical format or in the main panel (as a tab) for a horizontal format or if the plugin is a full featured app (lianahus and Rob Stupay were involved on this).

It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.\u201cThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution\u201d (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018).The EVM consists of a stack-based architecture. In order for a smart contract to be deployed, all high level Ethereum smart contract code must first be compiled into machine-readable code (called bytecode). This bytecode code (a series of single-byte opcodes and optional arguments) is then processed by the EVM via a last-in-first-out stack arrangement. This operation is similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) whereby every instruction begins with a single-byte opcode and arguments, if any, occupy subsequent (unaligned) bytes, with values given in big-endian order (Scott, 2009).The first goal of this article is to explain the inner workings of Ethereum\u2019s stack-based EVM. Once these EVM fundamentals are explained we will begin to see that Ethereum\u2019s organic conformity to the binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine has it poised to transition into the bright future of web assembly.Let\u2019s start with the end in mind by taking a look at web assembly.Web Assembly (abbreviated Wasm)WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers. It provides new features and major gains in performance. Wasm is designed to be an effective compilation target for low-level source languages like C, C++ and Rust etc (MDN Web Docs, 2019).Ethereum Web Assembly (abbreviated Ewasm)Ethereum Web Assembly (abbreviated Ewasm) is a deterministic smart contract execution engine built on the modern, standard WebAssembly virtual machine. Ewasm is the primary candidate to replace the EVM as part of the Ethereum 2.0 \u201cSerenity\u201d roadmap. Ewasm is also proposed for adoption on the Ethereum mainnet (ewasm, 2019).Why Ewasm?The current architecture of the EVM is one of the greatest blockers to raw performance (GitHub EIP48, 2019). For example, whilst the 256-bit word size facilitates native hashing and elliptic curve operations (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018), it also makes translation from EVM opcodes to hardware instructions more difficult than needed; an architecture that provides a closer mapping to hardware will considerably enhance Ethereum\u2019s performance (GitHub EIP48, 2019).Aside from the performance enhancement aspect, one of the design goals of the Ewasm project is to also support smart contract development across a wider range of languages and tooling i.e. incorporating LLVM, C, C++, Rust, JavaScript into the development cycle.In theory any language, that can be compiled to Wasm, can be used to write a smart contract. As long as it implements the Ewasm Contract Interface(ECI) and Ethereum Environment Interface(EEI) (ewasm, 2019).Smart ContractsLet\u2019s take a minute to understand the fundamentals of the EVM by walking through the creation, compilation and deployment of an Ethereum smart contract, using the original EVM architecture.Ethereum smart contracts are like \u201cautonomous agents\u201d that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when \u201cpoked\u201d by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own key/value store to keep track of persistent variables (Buterin, 2013).Each of the higher level smart contract source programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper and Lity maintain their own compiler. A smart contract\u2019s source code can be compiled into a variety of outputs. Including, but not limited to the application binary interface (ABI), bytecode stream and opcode.CompilingBefore installing a compiler on your local machine, I would urge you to check out new web-based compilers such as SecondState\u2019s BUIDL environment. This will save you an incredible amount of time.Let\u2019s take the simple storage source code and compile it using SecondState\u2019s BUIDL environment, as pictured below.Clicking the compile button will immediately produce the smart contract\u2019s ABI and bytecode, as shown below.If you would like to see how this compilation is performed in the command line (with a locally installed compiler), please see Appendix A, at the end of this article.Analysing the deployment bytecodeIf we look at the first 4 instructions in the bytecode we see the following.608060405234If we view the Mnemonic representations of these values, as referenced on page 30 of the Ethereum Yellow Paper, we will see that the first instruction (60) is PUSH1.\u03b4The column labelled \u03b4 to the right of Mnemonic, represents the number of items to be removed from the stack by the PUSH1 instruction (in this case 0).\u03b1The next column over, labelled \u03b1, represents the number of additional items to be placed on the stack, by the PUSH1 instruction. In this case 1; a single byte 0x80.In the example below we can now see that the first instruction (0x60) PUSH1, has pushed the value of 0x80 to the stack and that the second instruction (0x60) called PUSH1, has pushed the value of 0x40 to the stack.60806040\u2026PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40\u2026If we move along the bytecode, we then encounter the instruction with a value of 0x52. As you can see in the Yellow Paper below, this instruction has the Mnemonic representation of MSTORE.608060405234If we again look at the column labelled \u03b4 to the right of Mnemonic we can see that MSTORE is going to consume two items from the top of the stack. In total, MSTORE will consume the top 2 items from the stack but place 0 items back on the stack.It is important to point out, at this stage, that MSTORE is a Memory Operation which is tasked with saving a word to memory. Please don\u2019t get confused about the use of the term \u201cword\u201d.The EVM works with a word size of 256 bit (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018).This \u201cword\u201d is not a word per se. For example, it can be an account address etc.MSTORE starts its operation by first consuming the current item from the top of the stack; namely an address which specifies where the word will be stored in memory. In this case the address location of 0x60. MSTORE then consumes the next item from the stack and saves it (0x80) to the pre-specified address(0x60). At this stage there are no items left on the stack.The next instruction is (0x34). It has the Mnemonic representation of CALLVALUE.608060405234If we pay close attention to the column labelled \u03b1, we see that CALLVALUE will be placing one item on the stack, as part of its standard operation. However, we did just mentioned that the stack is currently empty and so this raises the following question. How does CALLVALUE obtain the data which it intends to place on the stack?As you can see from the Yellow Paper, all instructions which have values in the 30s (0x30 to 0x3e) relate to Environmental Information. In this case CALLVALUE obtains its required data from the message call responsible for executing this bytecode. Another example relating to Environmental Information is the instruction 0x33 which has the Mnemonic representation of CALLER. The CALLER instruction is able to automatically get the address of the Ethereum account which initiated the bytecode\u2019s execution.Deployment vs Runtime bytecodeIt is important to differentiate between the deployment and runtime bytecode at this juncture. If you look at Appendix A.1 (obtaining deployment bytecode) and Appendix A.2 (obtaining runtime bytecode) you will notice that the bytecode results, which are returned, are not identical.The runtime bytecode is the bytecode that is executed when functions of the deployed smart contract are called.The deployment bytecode contains additional instructions, relating specifically to deployment only.Interestingly, the runtime bytecode can always be seen as a subset of code, which resides verbatim inside the deployment bytecode. This is illustrated in the image below.Analysing the runtime bytecodeEach of the smart contract functions can be identified (inside the runtime bytecode) as a 4 byte function signature. To calculate the function signature we first take the function\u2019s name. In our case, let\u2019s start with our function \u201cset\u201d.Along with the function name \u201cset\u201d, we also take the function\u2019s input argument data types (separated by comma and wrapped in parentheses). For example, in our simple case we end up with the text set(uint256).Note: Do not use any spaces when creating the function selector text.Once we have this information we then create the hexadecimal representation of a sha3 hash and truncate it to only 4 bytes. Here are examples in both web3.js and web3.pyselectorHash = \"0x\" + str(web3.toHex(web3.sha3(text=\"set(uint256)\")))[2:10]var selectorHash = web3.sha3(\"set(uint256)\").substring(0,10)Both of the above commands will return the following signature 0x60fe47b1 which we can easily locate in both the deployment and runtime bytecode data.At this stage we have an understanding of how each instruction in the bytecode is carried out (giving and taking information from the stack, then calling environment and memory etc). We could continue to analyse each instruction in the bytecode and reference the Yellow Paper. However, we now have a good understanding of how calling code can execute state transition functions using environmental information and so forth so let\u2019s now move on to Ethereum\u2019s specific Ewasm implementation nuances.Ewasm implementationWe mentioned a little while ago that a smart contract\u2019s source code can be compiled into a variety of outputs. Of course the path from high level smart contract code to Ewasm is a complex task which can take on many and varied compilation paths through different toolchains.SecondState developers recently built a Solidity to Ewasm compiler called Soll.This challenging task was completed (as a prototype for demonstration purposes) prior to both:Crosslink \u2014 a conference for the world\u2019s leading blockchain researchers and developers, held in Taiwan\u2019s capital, Taipei)Devcon5 \u2014 an international conference for Ethereum developers, held in Osaka Japan)Crosslink (October 2019)Picture: SecondState\u2019s Hung-Ying Tai receiving an Ethereum Foundation Grant for the Soll compiler project (pictured with Vitalik Buterin at the Crosslink Taipei event).Devcon5 (October 2019)For those who were not at Devcon5, the following video provides an overview of Soll\u2019s operation. Namely deploying and interacting with an Ethereum ERC20 Solidity smart contract on the new Ethereum Ewasm testnet.Devcon5 was the perfect conference to share the latest Ewasm developments from the SecondState team. After formally presenting on the first day of the conference, an additional informal and open demonstration & discussion took place.The post-demo discussion with Solidity maintainer Christian Reitwiessner, and others, revealed SecondState\u2019s best path forward in terms of optimal collaboration and reduction of duplication of effort amongst different developers and software projects in the future Ewasm space.Having succeeded in prototyping compilation from Solidity to LLVM to Ewasm, SecondState, in response to valuable peer input, is looking forward to making extensive use of Yul in a bid to perform Yul to llvm to Ewasm compilation path.YulYul is an Ethereum specific intermediate language. Future versions of the Ethereum Solidity compiler (and possibly the Ethreum Vyper compiler) will comprehensively support Yul as an intermediate language.Yul is designed to be a usable common denominator of EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5 and Ewasm. The core components of Yul are functions, blocks, variables, literals, for-loops, if-statements, switch-statements, expressions and assignments to variables (Solidity \u2014 Yul, 2019).Backends or targets are the translators from Yul to a specific bytecode. Each of the backends can expose functions prefixed with the name of the backend. Yul reserves evm_ and ewasm_ prefixes for the two proposed backends (Solidity \u2014 Yul, 2019).A lot of work has already been done in this space, so let\u2019s take a brief look at what we already know about the path from Solidity to Yul to Ewasm.Compiling Solidity for YulThe solidity compiler has a special flag which can be used to compile Solidity source code into an intermediate representation (IR) of Yul.In order to provide an example of this feature, let\u2019s use Ethereum\u2019s Solidity compiler in the command line to compile our simple storage example from above into this YUL IR format.You will see from the code below that we can perform this task using the ir flag.Compiling Yul for EwasmA simple overview of the path from Yul includes the following steps.Starting with the EVM-Yul code, we need to:Split each 256 bit (32 byte) variable into 4 individual 64 bit (8 byte) variablesTake care of endian differencesCreate a library that implements each EVM opcode as user a defined function, using the equivalent Ewasm built in functionUtilise the regular optimiserFurther Solidity compilation examplesIf fed the above Yul IR, Solidity can also produce pretty printed source, binary representation and text representation.This is achieved with the following commandsolc/solc --strict-assembly --optimize ~/simple_storage/simple_storage_yul_ir.txtThe individual outputs are as followsPretty printed sourceBinary representationText representationAn example of the inner workingsChristian\u2019s Devcon5 presentation code example, revealed the inner workings of the Ewasm flavoured compilation process. More specifically, as shown here, the work required to produce the equivalent of the MSTORE function. As we demonstrated above, using the original EVM, MSTORE accepts 2 arguments (firstly a standard 32 byte address, and secondly a 256 bit (32 byte) word). However, as you can see, the code below shows the original Solidity smart contract 256 bit variables being split into separate 64 bit variables. You will also notice that endian swaps are occurring.function mstore(x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, y4) {    let pos := u256_to_i32ptr(x1, x2, x3, x4)    i64.store(pos, endian_swap(x1))    i64.store(i64.add(pos, 8), endian_swap(x2))    i64.store(i64.add(pos, 16), endian_swap(x3))    i64.store(i64.add(pos, 24), endian_swap(x4))}Available at: http://chriseth.github.io/notes/talks/yul_devcon5/#/11EndiannessThe swapping of endianness (the byte order for storing and retrieving bytes from memory) when compiling for Ewasm is crucial for the following reasons. The Ethereum Virtual Machine Specification employs big-endian byte ordering (Wood, 2014). However, the Web Assembly specification requires that all values are read and written in little endian (webassembly.github.io, 2019).As not to undersell any of the other required design efforts and hard work ahead, there are additional details which are currently undergoing consideration/discussion as this important work progresses. A few of these have been outlined in Appendix B below for brevity.ConclusionWhilst there are many potential paths between smart contract code and Ewasm. The use of Yul will provide a targeted endpoint for the current Ethereum compilers as well as an entry point for the llvm to Ewasm compiler. The Yul to llvm to Ewasm compiler will bring about the fundamental advantages of Wasm/Ewasm to any of the Yul compliant smart contract languages like Solidity and Vyper.Using Yul is a big win, because it can re-use almost all optimiser components (Reitwiessner, 2019).Further to this, given that other languages like Rust use LLVM as their primary codegen backend (Rust-lang.github.io, 2019), the above toolchain path will open the door for other programming languages to become part of Ethereum\u2019s Ewasm smart contract ecosystem.CC BY 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)ReferencesAntonopoulos, A. and Wood, G.

For example after installing Solidity, Vyper or Lity you will have access to the appropriate local compilation environment.Here is an example of how we would compile the simple storage smart contract, to obtain a variety of different outputs, using SecondState\u2019s Lity compiler.A.1 Obtaining deployment bytecodetpmccallum$ lityc/lityc --bin ~/simple_storage/simple_storage.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.2 Obtaining runtime bytecodetpmccallum$ lityc/lityc --bin-runtime ~/simple_storage/simple_storage.sol6080604052600436106049576000357c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000900463ffffffff16806360fe47b114604e5780636d4ce63c146085575b600080fd5b348015605957600080fd5b50608360048036036020811015606e57600080fd5b810190808035906020019092919050505060ad565b005b348015609057600080fd5b50609760b7565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b8060008190555050565b6000805490509056fea165627a7a7230582037a6182517eb7335095ca48cb7b895cbcbbdb824f48911f3f69fdc1869c7263e0029A.3 Obtaining opcodestpmccallum$ lityc/lityc --opcodes ~/simple_storage/simple_storage.solPUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH2 0x10 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP PUSH1 0xec DUP1 PUSH2 0x1f PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0x0 RETURN INVALID PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x4 CALLDATASIZE LT PUSH1 0x49 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 CALLDATALOAD PUSH29 0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 SWAP1 DIV PUSH4 0xffffffff AND DUP1 PUSH4 0x60fe47b1 EQ PUSH1 0x4e JUMPI DUP1 PUSH4 0x6d4ce63c EQ PUSH1 0x85 JUMPI JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH1 0x59 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP PUSH1 0x83 PUSH1 0x4 DUP1 CALLDATASIZE SUB PUSH1 0x20 DUP2 LT ISZERO PUSH1 0x6e JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST DUP2 ADD SWAP1 DUP1 DUP1 CALLDATALOAD SWAP1 PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP1 SWAP3 SWAP2 SWAP1 POP POP POP PUSH1 0xad JUMP JUMPDEST STOP JUMPDEST CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH1 0x90 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP PUSH1 0x97 PUSH1 0xb7 JUMP JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x40 MLOAD DUP1 DUP3 DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP2 POP POP PUSH1 0x40 MLOAD DUP1 SWAP2 SUB SWAP1 RETURN JUMPDEST DUP1 PUSH1 0x0 DUP2 SWAP1 SSTORE POP POP JUMP JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 SLOAD SWAP1 POP SWAP1 JUMP INVALID LOG1 PUSH6 0x627a7a723058 KECCAK256 CALLDATACOPY 0xa6 XOR 0x25 OR 0xeb PUSH20 0x35095ca48cb7b895cbcbbdb824f48911f3f69fdc XOR PUSH10 0xc7263e00290000000000A.4 Obtaining ABItpmccallum$ lityc/lityc --abi ~/simple_storage/simple_storage.sol[{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"x\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"set\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"constant\":true,\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"get\",\"outputs\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}]Appendix BTopics for future consideration/discussionInteracting with the rest of the 1.x EVMIn addition to the typical bytecode operations, i.e. stack, memory, and storage access, the original EVM also has access to account information, i.e. addresses and balances as well as block information and current gas price (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018). Storage access is instrumental for correct operation. For example, the execution of a valid transaction begins with an irrevocable change made to the state: the nonce of the account of the sender (Wood, 2014).The Ethereum 1.x roadmap indicates that there are unresolved questions about how Ewasm will interact with the rest of the EVM state i.e. contract storage, ether balances and so forth. One approach is to exclude Ewasm code from directly accessing EVM state, but allow it to exchange input/output when called (Docs.ethhub.io, 2019).Deterministic behaviourAs we know, Ewasm is a subset of Wasm, and Wasm has a couple of features which are non-deterministic. As Ewasm moves forward there will need to be a way to reject any contracts which have non-deterministic features (Docs.ethhub.io, 2019). At present it appears that this can be achieved by a single sentinel contract. The sentinel is a system contract (part of the genesis or hardfork Ewasm is enabled on). The sentinel contract has a raw interface which is used for contract validation during deployment. It works by deliberately issuing an invalid operation (invoking a regular failure) when an unexpected issue occurs or deliberately issuing the revert operation if invalid input is ever detected.Gas meteringThe calculation of gas for Ewasm contract deployment and interactions requires some future work. It is presently proposed that automatic upper bound estimations are used. Static analysis can be performed on the bytecode and, for a subset of codes, the upper bounds for executed instructions (virtual gas) can also be calculated (Docs.ethhub.io, 2019).", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ewasm", "Solidity", "Vyper", "Second State"]}, {"title": "Monti Software Smart Contracts Security Analysis", "post_link": "https://blog.smartdec.net/monti-software-smart-contracts-security-analysis-475777e7d5aa?source=search_post", "author_name": "Boris Nikashin", "author_link": "https://blog.smartdec.net/@boris_98005", "publish_date": "2019-01-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-29", "readtime": "7.82", "claps": 109, "voters": 3, "content": "Monti Software Smart Contracts Security AnalysisBoris NikashinFollowJan 28 \u00b7 8 min readIn this report, we consider the security of the Monti Software project.

One audit cannot be considered enough. We always recommend proceeding with several independent audits and a public bug bounty program to ensure the security of smart contracts. Besides, a security audit is not an investment advice.SummaryIn this report, we considered the security of Monti Software smart contracts. We performed our audit according to the procedure described below. The initial audit showed no critical issues. However, a number of medium and low severity issues were found. Most of them were fixed in the latest version of the code.General recommendationsThe contracts code is of good code quality. However, we recommend implementing Tests and deployment scripts.ProcedureIn our audit, we consider the following crucial features of the smart contract code:Whether the code is secureWhether the code corresponds to the documentation (including whitepaper)Whether the code meets best practices in efficient use of gas, code readability, etc.We perform our audit according to the following procedure:Automated analysiswe scan project\u2019s smart contracts with our own Vyper static code analyzer SmartCheckwe manually verify (reject or confirm) all the issues found by the toolManual auditwe manually analyze smart contracts for security vulnerabilitieswe check smart contracts logic and compare it with the one described in the documentationwe check ERC20 complianceReportwe reflect all the gathered information in the reportChecked vulnerabilitiesWe have scanned Monti Software smart contracts for commonly known and more specific vulnerabilities.

Here are the results of SmartCheck scanning. All the issues found by the tool were manually checked (rejected or confirmed).Manual analysisThe contracts were completely manually analyzed, their logic was checked and compared with the one described in the documentation. Besides, the results of the automated analysis were manually verified. All confirmed issues are described below.Critical issuesCritical issues seriously endanger smart contracts security. We highly recommend fixing them.The audit showed no critical issues.Medium severity issuesMedium issues can influence smart contracts operation in the current implementation. We highly recommend addressing them.BugsThere are several bugs in the contracts code:uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 60\u201366:def sqrt(x: uint256) -> uint256:    z: uint256 = (x + 1) / 2    y: uint256 = x    for i in range(18):        y = z        z = ((x / z) + z) / 2    return yThis function fails with an exception due to division by zero if x equals zero (sqrt(0)).

We recommend fixing sqrt() function by separately considering the case when x is equal to zero.uniswap_factory.vy, lines 24\u201325:self.default_max_platform_fee = 1000self.default_max_swap_fee = 1000However, the accuracy of calculations is 1/10000 in uniswap_exchange.vy file.Also, the comment in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 33 says:# must be between 1 to 10000 that represent the the fee percent from 10000We recommend replacing the values of default_max_platform_fee and default_max_swap_fee variables with 10000.The formula used in calculate_platform_profit() function is incorrect (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 73):platform_liquidity_minted: uint256 = (total_liquidity * platform_profit * self.platform_fee /(10000 + platform_profit * (10000 \u2014 self.platform_fee))) / 1000platform_profit variable in the denominator of the fraction should be divided by 1000. We recommend replacing this formula with the following one:platform_liquidity_minted: uint256 = total_liquidity * platform_profit * self.platform_fee /(10000000 + platform_profit * (10000 \u2014 self.platform_fee))The initial formula was modified. The recheck did not reveal any vulnerabilities in the new one.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.Invalid code logicThere is a code logic issue in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 578:def token_scrape(token_addr: address, deadline: timestamp)token_scrape() function works incorrectly: ETH received after Exchange(exchange_addr).tokenToEthSwapInput() call will trigger __default__() function of the current exchange contract. Thus, ethToTokenInput() function will be called with 2300 gas stipend provided by send() function. Therefore, the whole transaction will revert with an out-of-gas exception. Hence, it is impossible to unlock stuck tokens. We highly recommend fixing this functionality.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.No tests and deployment scriptThe provided code does not contain tests. Testing is crucial for code security and audit does not replace tests in any way.We highly recommend both covering the code with tests and making sure that the test coverage is sufficient.There is also no deployment script. However, the contracts deployment does not seem trivial. Bugs and vulnerabilities often appear in deployment scripts and severely endanger system\u2019s security. We highly recommend developing and testing deployment scripts very carefully.Low severity issuesLow severity issues can influence smart contracts operation in future versions of code. We recommend taking them into account.Lack of the documentationThe documentation provided with the code is not complete. The information regarding the formula used in calculate_platform_profit() function (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 70) is not sufficient. We recommend clarifying the description of this formula in the documentation.BugThere is a bug in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 112:self.previous_invariant = as_unitless_number(msg.value) * max_tokensWe recommend calculating self.previous_invariant variable in the same way as on line 99:self.previous_invariant = as_unitless_number(self.balance) * (token_reserve + token_amount)This formula is more secure as ETH or tokens can be transferred to the contract before the first addLiquidity() function call.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.ERC20 approveThere is ERC20 approve issue in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 536: changing the approved amount from a nonzero value to another nonzero value allows a double spending with a front-running attack.We recommend implementing increaseApproval() and decreaseApproval() functions. Moreover, we recommend instructing users to follow one of two ways:not to use approve() function directly and to use increaseApproval()/decreaseApproval() functions insteadto change the approved amount to 0, wait for the transaction to be mined, and then to change the approved amount to the desired valueThe issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code. Nevertheless, we still recommend instructing users in the ways described above.Invalid valuesThe values of name and symbol state variables used for the liquidity tokens are the same as in the original project (uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 47\u201348):self.name = 0x556e69737761702056310000...self.symbol = 0x554e492d56310000...We recommend replacing them with the new ones.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Wrong ABIIn abi folder, uniswap_exchange.json and uniswap_factory.json files do not match the corresponding ABI files, generated by the compiler. We recommend replacing wrong ABI with the correct ones.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.TypoWe found several typos in the code:uniswap_factory.vy:defualt_swap_fee: uint256There should be default_swap_fee instead of defualt_swap_fee across the file.uniswap_exchange.vy, line 70:def cacluate_platform_profit(eth_reserve: uint256, token_reserve: uint256) -> uint256:There should be calculate_platform_profitinstead of cacluate_platform_profit()uniswap_exchange.vy, line 77:@dev min_amount has a djfferent meaning when total UNI supply is 0.There should be different instead of djfferent.In uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 147,161:@dev Pricing functon for converting between ETH and Tokens.There should be function instead of functon.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.NatSpec mismatchThere are several NatSpec comments mismatches:uniswap_exchange.vy, line 79: max_tokens should be used instead of min_amount.uniswap_exchange.vy, line 452: exchange_addr should be used instead of token_addr.We highly recommend fixing all the mismatches and using the NatSpec accurately and correctly.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.Code styleIn uniswap_factory.vy file, initializeFactory() function is used for variables initialization. However, it is not the best practice. We recommend using the constructor for state variables initialization instead.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Redundant codeThe following line is redundant (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 108):token_amount: uint256 = max_tokenstoken_amount variable is redundant as it is equal to max_token variable. We highly recommend removing redundant code in order to improve code readability and transparency and decrease cost of deployment and execution.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Missing checksThere are several missing checks in the code:uniswap_factory.vy, lines 47\u201350, 53\u201356:def setMaxPlatformFee(_default_max_platform_fee: uint256)def setMaxSwapFee(_default_max_swap_fee: uint256)In these functions the new maximum value is not checked to be greater than the corresponding current fee value (default_platform_fee or default_swap_fee respectively). We highly recommend implementing the following checks in setMaxPlatformFee() and setMaxSwapFee() functions respectively:assert _default_max_platform_fee >= self.default_platform_feeassert _default_max_swap_fee >= self.default_swap_feeIn tokenToTokenTransferInput() and tokenToTokenTransferOutput() functions (uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 355\u2013357, 397\u2013399) the following check is missing:assert recipient != selfWe highly recommend implementing missing check in order to avoid loss of tokens.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.NotesMalicious tokensThe platform is designed to be used with various tokens with an unknown code. This can lead to the undesired consequences for the corresponding uniswap_exchange contracts:Reentrancy at lines 256\u2013257:send(recipient, wei_bought)assert self.token.transferFrom(buyer, self, tokens_sold)Reentrancy at lines 291\u2013292:send(recipient, eth_bought)assert self.token.transferFrom(buyer, self, tokens_sold)Impact on the economy due to unlimited mint/burn functionality. For instance, if the token owner burns tokens from uniswap_exchange contract, the invariant will decrease.As this problem cannot be fixed, we recommend taking it into account.Unexpected ETH/tokensprevious_invariant state variable of uniswap_exchange contract is supposed to keep invariant at the moment of the last addLiquidity()/ removeLiquidity() functions call. Moreover, the difference between the new invariant and the previous one is supposed to appear based on the fees from the trade volume. However, it can also be changed by sending ETH or tokens to the contract using selfdestruct() and transfer() functions respectively without calling the addLiquidity()/removeLiquidity() functions. We recommend taking it into account.NatSpec misuseThe NatSpec comments in the code violates the Vyper Documentation (starting from v0.1.0-beta.6). We recommend using triple quotes (\"\"\") instead of hashes (#) to highlight NatSpec comments.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Private visibility levelPrivate visibility level is used in the following lines:uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 27\u201338:balances: uint256[address]allowances: (uint256[address])[address]token: address(ERC20)factory: Factorylast_invariant: decimalowner: addressplatform_fee: uint256platform_fee_max: uint256swap_fee: uint256swap_fee_max: uint256anotherToken: address(ERC20)previous_invariant: uint256uniswap_factory.vy, lines 12\u201315:defualt_swap_fee: uint256default_platform_fee: uint256default_max_swap_fee: uint256default_max_platform_fee: uint256We recommend taking into account that, \u0441ontrary to a popular misconception, anyone can see values of private variables in the blockchain.This audit was performed by SmartDec, a security team specialized in static code analysis, decompilation and secure development.Feel free to use SmartCheck, our smart contract security tool for Solidity and Vyper languages, and follow us on Medium.

Have doubts about switching to MVVM? Heard about VIPER, but not sure if it worth it?Keep reading, and you will find answers to questions above, if you don\u2019t \u2014 feel free to complain in comments.You are about to structure your knowledge about architectural patterns in iOS environment. We\u2019ll briefly review some popular ones and compare them in theory and practice going over a few tiny examples. Follow links if you need more details about any particular one.Mastering design patterns might be addictive, so beware: you might end up asking yourself more questions now than before reading this article, like these:Who supposed to own networking request: a Model or a Controller?How do I pass a Model into a View Model of a new View?Who creates a new VIPER module: Router or Presenter?Why care about choosing the architecture?Because if you don\u2019t, one day, debugging a huge class with dozens different things, you\u2019ll find yourself being unable to find and fix any bugs in your class.\u201d. Naturally, it is hard to keep this class in mind as whole entity, thus, you\u2019ll always be missing some important details. If you are already in this situation with your application, it is very likely that:This class is the UIViewController subclass.Your data stored directly in the UIViewControllerYour UIViews do almost nothingThe Model is a dumb data structureYour Unit Tests cover nothingAnd this can happen, even despite the fact that you are following Apple\u2019s guidelines and implementing Apple\u2019s MVC pattern, so don\u2019t feel bad. There is something wrong with the Apple\u2019s MVC, but we\u2019ll get back to it later.Let\u2019s define features of a good architecture:Balanced distribution of responsibilities among entities with strict roles.Testability usually comes from the first feature (and don\u2019t worry: it is easy with appropriate architecture).Ease of use and a low maintenance cost.Why Distribution?Distribution keeps a fair load on our brain while we trying to figure out how things work. If you think the more you develop the better your brain will adapt to understanding complexity, then you are right. But this ability doesn\u2019t scale linearly and reaches the cap very quickly. So the easiest way to defeat complexity is to divide responsibilities among multiple entities following the single responsibility principle.Why Testability?This is usually not a question for those who already felt gratitude to unit tests, which failed after adding new features or due to refactoring some intricacies of the class. This means the tests saved those developers from finding issues in runtime, which might happen when an app is on a user\u2019s device and the fix takes a week to reach the user.Why Ease of use?This does not require an answer but it is worth mentioning that the best code is the code that has never been written. Therefore the less code you have, the less bugs you have. This means that desire to write less code should never be explained solely by laziness of a developer, and you should not favour a smarter solution closing your eyes to its maintenance cost.MV(X) essentialsNowadays we have many options when it comes to architecture design patterns:MVCMVPMVVMVIPERFirst three of them assume putting the entities of the app into one of 3 categories:Models \u2014 responsible for the domain data or a data access layer which manipulates the data, think of \u2018Person\u2019 or \u2018PersonDataProvider\u2019 classes.Views \u2014 responsible for the presentation layer (GUI), for iOS environment think of everything starting with \u2018UI\u2019 prefix.Controller/Presenter/ViewModel \u2014 the glue or the mediator between the Model and the View, in general responsible for altering the Model by reacting to the user\u2019s actions performed on the View and updating the View with changes from the Model.Having entities divided allows us to:understand them better (as we already know)reuse them (mostly applicable to the View and the Model)test them independentlyLet\u2019s start with MV(X) patterns and get back to VIPER later.MVCHow it used to beBefore discussing Apple\u2019s vision of MVC let\u2019s have a look on the traditional one.Traditional MVCIn this case, the View is stateless. It is simply rendered by the Controller once the Model is changed. Think of the web page completely reloaded once you press on the link to navigate somewhere else. Although it is possible to implement the traditional MVC in iOS application, it doesn\u2019t make much sense due to the architectural problem \u2014 all three entities are tightly coupled, each entity knows about the other two. This dramatically reduces reusability of each of them \u2014 that is not what you want to have in your application. For this reason, we skip even trying to write a canonical MVC example.Traditional MVC doesn't seems to be applicable to modern iOS development.Apple\u2019s MVCExpectationCocoa MVCThe Controller is a mediator between the View and the Model so that they don\u2019t know about each other. The least reusable is the Controller and this is usually fine for us, since we must have a place for all that tricky business logic that doesn\u2019t fit into the Model.In theory, it looks very straightforward, but you feel that something is wrong, right? You even heard people unabbreviating MVC as the Massive View Controller. Moreover, view controller offloading became an important topic for the iOS developers. Why does this happen if Apple just took the traditional MVC and improved it a bit?Apple\u2019s MVCRealityRealistic Cocoa MVCCocoa MVC encourages you to write Massive View Controllers, because they are so involved in View\u2019s life cycle that it\u2019s hard to say they are separate. Although you still have ability to offload some of the business logic and data transformation to the Model, you don\u2019t have much choice when it comes to offloading work to the View, at most of times all the responsibility of the View is to send actions to the Controller. The view controller ends up being a delegate and a data source of everything, and is usually responsible for dispatching and cancelling the network requests and\u2026 you name it.How many times have you seen code like this:The cell, which is the View configured directly with the Model, so MVC guidelines are violated, but this happens all the time, and usually people don\u2019t feel it is wrong. If you strictly follow the MVC, then you supposed to configure the cell from the controller, and don\u2019t pass the Model into the View, and this will increase the size of your Controller even more.Cocoa MVC is reasonably unabbreviated as the Massive View Controller.The problem might not be evident until it comes to the Unit Testing (hopefully, it does in your project). Since your view controller is tightly coupled with the view, it becomes difficult to test because you have to be very creative in mocking views and their life cycle, while writing the view controller\u2019s code in such a way, that your business logic is separated as much as possible from the view layout code.Let\u2019s have a look on the simple playground example:UPD: See updated code examples by Wasin ThonkaewMVC exampleMVC assembling can be performed in the presenting view controllerThis doesn\u2019t seem very testable, right? We can move generation of greeting into the new GreetingModel class and test it separately, but we can\u2019t test any presentation logic (although there is not much of such logic in the example above) inside the GreetingViewController without calling the UIView related methods directly (viewDidLoad, didTapButton) which might cause loading all views, and this is bad for the unit testing.In fact, loading and testing UIViews on one simulator (e.g. iPhone 4S) doesn\u2019t guarantee that it would work fine on the other devices (e.g. iPad), so I\u2019d recommend to remove \u201cHost Application\u201d from your Unit Test target configuration and run your tests without your application running on simulator.The interactions between the View and the Controller aren\u2019t really testable with Unit TestsWith all that said, it might seems that Cocoa MVC is a pretty bad pattern to choose. But let\u2019s assess it in terms of features defined in the beginning of the article:Distribution \u2014 the View and the Model in fact separated, but the View and the Controller are tightly coupled.Testability \u2014 due to the bad distribution you\u2019ll probably only test your Model.Ease of use \u2014 the least amount of code among others patterns. In addition everyone is familiar with it, thus, it\u2019s easily maintained even by the unexperienced developers.Cocoa MVC is the pattern of your choice if you are not ready to invest more time in your architecture, and you feel that something with higher maintenance cost is an overkill for your tiny pet project.Cocoa MVC is the best architectural pattern in terms of the speed of the development.MVPCocoa MVC\u2019s promises deliveredPassive View variant of MVPDoesn\u2019t it look exactly like the Apple\u2019s MVC? Yes, it does, and it\u2019s name is MVP (Passive View variant). But wait a minute\u2026 Does this mean that Apple\u2019s MVC is in fact a MVP? No, its not, because if you recall, there, the View is tightly coupled with the Controller, while the MVP\u2019s mediator, Presenter, has nothing to do with the life cycle of the view controller, and the View can be mocked easily, so there is no layout code in the Presenter at all, but it is responsible for updating the View with data and state.What if I told you, the UIViewController is the View.In terms of the MVP, the UIViewController subclasses are in fact the Views and not the Presenters. This distinction provides superb testability, which comes at cost of the development speed, because you have to make manual data and event binding, as you can see from the example:MVP exampleImportant note regarding assemblyThe MVP is the first pattern that reveals the assembly problem which happens due to having three actually separate layers. Since we don\u2019t want the View to know about the Model, it is not right to perform assembly in presenting view controller (which is the View), thus we have to do it somewhere else. For example, we can make the app-wide Router service which will be responsible for performing assembly and the View-to-View presentation. This issue arises and has to be addressed not only in the MVP but also in all the following patterns.Let\u2019s look on the features of the MVP:Distribution \u2014 we have the most of responsibilities divided between the Presenter and the Model, with the pretty dumb View (in the example above the Model is dumb as well).Testability \u2014 is excellent, we can test most of the business logic due to the dumb View.Easy of use \u2014 in our unrealistically simple example, the amount of code is doubled compared to the MVC, but at the same time, idea of the MVP is very clear.MVP in iOS means superb testability and a lot of code.MVPWith Bindings and HootersThere is the other flavour of the MVP \u2014 the Supervising Controller MVP. This variant includes direct binding of the View and the Model while the Presenter (The Supervising Controller) still handles actions from the View and is capable of changing the View.Supervising Presenter variant of the MVPBut as we have already learned before, vague responsibility separation is bad, as well as tight coupling of the View and the Model. That is similar to how things work in Cocoa desktop development.Same as with the traditional MVC, I don\u2019t see a point in writing an example for the flawed architecture.MVVMThe latest and the greatest of the MV(X) kindThe MVVM is the newest of MV(X) kind thus, let\u2019s hope it emerged taking into account problems MV(X) was facing previously.In theory the Model-View-ViewModel looks very good. The View and the Model are already familiar to us, but also the Mediator, represented as the View Model.MVVMIt is pretty similar to the MVP:the MVVM treats the view controller as the ViewThere is no tight coupling between the View and the ModelIn addition, it does binding like the Supervising version of the MVP; however, this time not between the View and the Model, but between the View and the View Model.So what is the View Model in the iOS reality? It is basically UIKit independent representation of your View and its state. The View Model invokes changes in the Model and updates itself with the updated Model, and since we have a binding between the View and the View Model, the first is updated accordingly.BindingsI briefly mentioned them in the MVP part, but let\u2019s discuss them a bit here. Bindings come out of box for the OS X development, but we don\u2019t have them in the iOS toolbox. Of course we have the KVO and notifications, but they aren\u2019t as convenient as bindings.So, provided we don\u2019t want to write them ourselves, we have two options:One of the KVO based binding libraries like the RZDataBinding or the SwiftBondThe full scale functional reactive programming beasts like ReactiveCocoa, RxSwift or PromiseKit.In fact, nowadays, if you hear \u201cMVVM\u201d \u2014 you think ReactiveCocoa, and vice versa. Although it is possible to build the MVVM with the simple bindings, ReactiveCocoa (or siblings) will allow you to get most of the MVVM.There is one bitter truth about reactive frameworks: the great power comes with the great responsibility. It\u2019s really easy to mess up things when you go reactive. In other words, if you do something wrong, you might spend a lot of time debugging the app, so just take a look at this call stack.Reactive DebuggingIn our simple example, the FRF framework or even the KVO is an overkill, instead we\u2019ll explicitly ask the View Model to update using showGreeting method and use the simple property for greetingDidChange callback function.MVVM exampleAnd again back to our feature assessment:Distribution \u2014 it is not clear in our tiny example, but, in fact, the MVVM\u2019s View has more responsibilities than the MVP\u2019s View. Because the first one updates it\u2019s state from the View Model by setting up bindings, when the second one just forwards all events to the Presenter and doesn\u2019t update itself.Testability \u2014 the View Model knows nothing about the View, this allows us to test it easily. The View might be also tested, but since it is UIKit dependant you might want to skip it.Easy of use \u2014 its has the same amount of code as the MVP in our example, but in the real app where you\u2019d have to forward all events from the View to the Presenter and to update the View manually, MVVM would be much skinnier if you used bindings.The MVVM is very attractive, since it combines benefits of the aforementioned approaches, and, in addition, it doesn\u2019t require extra code for the View updates due to the bindings on the View side. Nevertheless, testability is still on a good level.VIPERLEGO building experience transferred into the iOS app designVIPER is our last candidate, which is particularly interesting because it doesn\u2019t come from the MV(X) category.By now, you must agree that the granularity in responsibilities is very good. VIPER makes another iteration on the idea of separating responsibilities, and this time we have five layers.VIPERInteractor \u2014 contains business logic related to the data (Entities) or networking, like creating new instances of entities or fetching them from the server. For those purposes you\u2019ll use some Services and Managers which are not considered as a part of VIPER module but rather an external dependency.Presenter \u2014 contains the UI related (but UIKit independent) business logic, invokes methods on the Interactor.Entities \u2014 your plain data objects, not the data access layer, because that is a responsibility of the Interactor.Router \u2014 responsible for the segues between the VIPER modules.Basically, VIPER module can be a one screen or the whole user story of your application \u2014 think of authentication, which can be one screen or several related ones. How small are your \u201cLEGO\u201d blocks supposed to be? \u2014 It\u2019s up to you.If we compare it with the MV(X) kind, we\u2019ll see a few differences of the distribution of responsibilities:Model (data interaction) logic shifted into the Interactor with the Entities as dumb data structures.Only the UI representation duties of the Controller/Presenter/ViewModel moved into the Presenter, but not the data altering capabilities.VIPER is the first pattern which explicitly addresses navigation responsibility, which is supposed to be resolved by the Router.Proper way of doing routing is a challenge for the iOS applications, the MV(X) patterns simply don\u2019t address this issue.The example doesn\u2019t cover routing or interaction between modules, as those topics are not covered by the MV(X) patterns at all.Yet again, back to the features:Distribution \u2014 undoubtedly, VIPER is a champion in distribution of responsibilities.Testability \u2014no surprises here, better distribution \u2014 better testability.Easy of use \u2014 finally, two above come in cost of maintainability as you already guessed. You have to write huge amount of interface for classes with very small responsibilities.So what about LEGO?While using VIPER, you might feel like building The Empire State Building from LEGO blocks, and that is a signal that you have a problem. Maybe, it\u2019s too early to adopt VIPER for your application and you should consider something simpler. Some people ignore this and continue shooting out of cannon into sparrows. I assume they believe that their apps will benefit from VIPER at least in the future, even if now the maintenance cost is unreasonably high. If you believe the same, then I\u2019d recommend you to try Generamba \u2014 a tool for generating VIPER skeletons. Although for me personally it feels like using an automated targeting system for cannon instead of simply taking a sling shot.ConclusionWe went though several architectural patterns, and I hope you have found some answers to what bothered you, but I have no doubt that you realised that there is no silver bullet so choosing architecture pattern is a matter of weighting tradeoffs in your particular situation.Therefore, it is natural to have a mix of architectures in same app. For example: you\u2019ve started with MVC, then you realised that one particular screen became too hard to maintain efficiently with the MVC and switched to the MVVM, but only for this particular screen. There is no need to refactor other screens for which the MVC actually does work fine, because both of architectures are easily compatible.Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler \u2014 Albert EinsteinThank you for reading!

Heck, we\u2019re not even talking about \u201carchitecture\u201d at all! \ud83e\udd28In his YouTube video \u201cClean iOS Architecture\u201d, Caio Zullo explains very clearly that the \u201csoftware architectures\u201d MVVM, VIPER, Clean Swift, etc. are not really architectures, but design patterns.So, even if it\u2019s not correct, let\u2019s stick to the usual term \u201carchitecture\u201d. Which one is now the best of them?Of course, it\u2019s always your own! \ud83d\ude01If you develop a single-screen hobby app on your own, you usually need a different architecture than a decentralized 10-man team working on a 1M $ app.The architecture has to fit the team and the project!In his lecture \u201cThe Lost Art of System Design\u201d, John Sundell encourages you to develop your own architecture that fits with your own team and project.That\u2019s exactly what I did, and now I want to share what I have learned in my \u201cPieces of a scalable iOS app architecture\u201d series of blog posts. I hope there are some developers out there who will find this interesting and can take some inspiration for their own projects.Of course, I always strive to improve myself and my architecture and look forward to appropriately constructive criticism. \ud83e\udd17Aim of an ArchitectureAn architecture should usually:Fix the Massive-View-Controller issueIncrease testabilityImprove maintainabilityScale with team sizeThe solution is actually quite simple: Modularization \ud83d\ude0eModularization means separating a program\u2019s functionality into independent, interchangeable units, each responsible for only one aspect of the program.For example, in Swift, you can outsource code into frameworks, such as a server module, which is only responsible for communicating with a server. In the app, server requests are no longer performed but only via the server module. This server module can be replaced, rewritten and tested separately from the rest of the app.But, you do not have to outsource everything into frameworks. It\u2019s often enough if you write specialized classes that are only responsible for one aspect and are referenced via protocols. Again, the code is bundled, does only one thing and can be easily replaced thanks to the protocol.Divided into modules, one usually quickly fixes the Massive-View-Controller problem because code that does not actually belong in a ViewController is outsourced into modules. The ViewController then shrinks automatically. \ud83d\ude09Interchangeability increases testability because it makes it easy to mock dependencies and test modules separately. And if every member of the team only works on their independent code module that also has a highly standardized interface, merge conflicts should be very rare, so it scales well with the team size.All the common architectures are usually based on modularization. Special classes such as controllers, models or workers, however you may call them, separate code and become more testable via protocols. How exactly this has to be separated is dictated by the respective design pattern.The established architectures already solve the listed problems. Hence, nothing is wrong with working with an established architecture. Bohdan Orlov provides a good insight into established architectures in his article \u201ciOS Architecture Patterns\u201d. And if you like it more complex, you can look at Uber\u2019s RIBs. \ud83e\uddd0Personally, I don\u2019t particularly like a few aspects of the established architectures.The MVVM\u2018s binding is very interesting, but the separation does not go far enough.With Clean Swift, I find the unidirectional data flow nice, but most of the time the presenter atrophies because it usually does nothing except pass data.VIPER is still one of my favorites and apparently it\u2019s not just me, but does everything really have to go through the presenter?And Uber\u2019s RIBs actually goes too far for me with its complexity. \ud83d\ude11My ApproachOf course, my approach is heavily inspired by the popular architectures. The goal is an architecture that works well in a decentralized team of two to five iOS developers per project and is easy to understand.Scalability, maintainability and testability are important aspects. The SOLID principles have to be applied, view and logic especially must be separated, the ViewController should do virtually nothing and dependencies should be resolved via Dependency Injection (DI).Here is a rough overview:Architecture overviewUser interactions in the Display are communicated to the Logic via an Interactor. The Logic then evaluates these events through its business logic, possibly changes the internal state and transmits data via the Presenter back to the Display.If the Logic decides to switch to another Scene, then this is done via the Navigator in the Core. The Core has a reference to the Container with the Dependencies, including a Factory. The Factory then creates new Dependencies, such as Scenes, where the Dependencies are injected.The new Scene then has its own Core and thus a ViewController (VC), which in turn creates the associated Display and the Logic.Summarized at the heart of this architecture are Scenes consisting of a Display, a Logic and a Core. Very simple, eh? That\u2019s not more complex than the Model-View-Controller architecture. \ud83d\ude09The Big PictureFor a better overview, here the dependency graph:Dependency graphArrows everywhere! Sure, that\u2019s simple! \ud83e\udd2aRed arrows represent direct dependencies because concrete classes are instantiated. The VC creates, for example, all major Display classes and the Factory concrete ViewControllers.Black arrows with a filled head are dependencies because of method calls. Usually, methods are called via interfaces, which are identified by the angle brackets in the name. The Logic, for example, knows only the interface of the Presenter, not the concrete Presenter class and thus calls only methods of the Presenter\u2019s interface.Black arrows with white tips represent inheritances or implementations of interfaces. The concrete Presenter class in the Display module implements, for example, the Presenter interface while the VC of course inherits from UIViewController.A Scene represents an app view, i.e. a View including ViewController and everything that goes with it. One Scene = one app screen.In the project structure, this is then reflected by putting all Scene code into its own folder so that the associated code is not distributed but is close to each other. If two developers work on different Scenes, they will therefore rarely get in each other\u2019s way.As shown in the diagram, the Core module contains the VC and the Navigator. The Navigator is responsible for transitioning to other Scenes.The Display module bundles the View as well as the Presenter and the Interactor, because they are all very much interwoven with the View. Any formatter, TableViewController and the like are also part of the Display.The Logic contains the entire business logic, as well as the current scene state. In addition, the Logic can address any Workers. Workers are independent outsourced logic units, such as a server request framework.Dependencies include the DependencyContainer. There is also a Factory for creating new Dependencies, such as new Scenes or sub-dependencies.Everything clear? \ud83e\udd13The Individual Actors in DetailThe actors are best shown by a concrete implementation. Therefore, I would recommend to look at the DemoApp Project (DAP) in parallel.In the DAP, we look at a concrete Scene named \u201cScene1\u201d below. The Scene can be found in the project under \u201cDemoApp/Scenes/Act1/Scene1\u201d.VCThe Scene1VC is in the Core. Its task is to provide all interfaces of a UIViewController, e.g. to implement viewWillAppear if necessary. loadView is overridden here to create its own Scene1View.A ViewController represents the root object of a Scene and thus it is also responsible for creating the other components of the Scene, such as the Presenter, the Logic, the Navigator, any TableController, etc. This is usually done in the init method or in loadView.However, a VC should not do more. Anything beyond the implementation of the UIKit interfaces does not belong in the VC anymore. So if you are writing methods in the VC without the override keyword, you are probably in the wrong class. Thus there are no scene transitions, no data feeding of the view and certainly no business logic.The only useful tests for a VC is end-to-end testing, which can be done via UITests.NavigatorThe Scene1Navigator in the Core implements the Scene1NavigatorInterface protocol. A Navigator is responsible for the transition to other Scenes, which is otherwise often done in a ViewController.The Navigator needs a reference to the Scene\u2019s UIViewController. It also needs to know if a UINavigationController is being used, whether the next Scene is presented modally or how else the structural design is defined.The Factory can be accessed via the Dependencies in the Act1DCInterface. It creates the UIViewController of the required Scene so that the Navigator is not directly dependent on the Scene and only cares about the presentation of a ViewController.More information can be found in my article \u201cSmall Navigators for Scene transitions in iOS\u201d.LogicThe Scene1Logic implements the Scene1LogicInterface protocol. The interface lists all use cases, which may be user-initiated actions, e.g. searchForText, or initiated by the system, e.g. displayRotated. The Logic finally implements the associated business logic, and everything else is then outsourced into workers or subclasses.To save the current state of the Logic, the LogicState struct in Scene1LogicState is used. The initial state is usually set when the Logic is initialized. The values are provided with a setupModel parameter.The Logic needs access to the Presenter to communicate any status changes to the View. It also requires access to the Navigator for changing the Scene. These are assigned with the Logic\u2019s own LoginDependencies struct via DI and referenced only by their interfaces.By extracting all specialized code into workers, the Logic should be relatively light, leaving only state manipulation, comparison, and delegation. Less code means less can break. Of course, the Logic is literally begging for unit and integration tests. \ud83d\ude06For more information about the Logic and the other Display parts, please read my article \u201cDecoupling Display and Logic in iOS\u201d.ViewThe Scene1View in the Display represents the concrete subclass of a UIView. Its task is to create the view hierarchy, that is to say place subviews, provide constraints and define their default styles.The View has no further logic, so it knows nothing about the formatting of data or of any app states. The only logic of the View would be view hierarchy manipulation, such as adding and removing subviews, e.g. for embedded sub-controllers, or maybe when activating and deactivating subviews.It makes no sense to mock a View, so there is no interface protocol for Views. Views can be unit tested via snapshot testing or they will be tested via UITests.InteractorThe Scene1Interactor in the Display also has no interface protocol. It also does not need one, because only the VC knows about it and only because it creates the Interactor, which then hooks itself into the View and the Logic.The task of the Interactor is to create a binding between the View and the Logic like in the MVVM architecture. So, any user input is mapped to the use case methods of the Logic. Here Rx seems to fit well, but that is not mandatory.Just like the View, this piece of code could also possibly be replaced in the future by SwiftUI and Combine. \ud83e\udd17PresenterThe Scene1Presenter in the Display implements the associated Scene1PresenterInterface protocol. A Presenter is the counterpart of the Interactor because instead of a flow from View to Logic, the Presenter allows the flow from the Logic to the View. Logic and View are completely separate from each other, and the data flow is unidirectional due to the division into Presenter and Interactor similar to the Clean Swift architecture.The task of the Presenter is to manipulate the View so that passed data is displayed and any styles applied. The Presenter can use formatters to prepare the data. The data in the view, or the subviews, are set directly by the Presenter. The View does not need to know anything about data, and the Logic does not know anything about the View. That\u2019s the domain of the Presenter instead.Not all data is to be assigned to the View. Some may also be intended for the ViewController, e.g. a title for the NavigationBar. For this, the Presenter also needs a reference to the UIViewController of the Scene.The Presenter must also be able to access any TableViewController to be able to update subviews such as TableViews or CollectionViews.Except for any formatting, the only logic of the Presenter is to put the data in the right places in the View and possibly to style any subviews depending on state changes. However, sometimes the Presenter is also responsible for applying some animations, and that can become quite complex.As part of the Display and tightly connected to the View, the best way to test the Presenter is via UITests or partially by unit testing the view via snapshot testing.DependenciesThe Act1Dependencies with the Act1DependenciesInterface are placed in a parent group. Not part of a single Scene, but more like a theater act, the Act represents several Scenes of an app-state, e.g. a pre-login or onboarding over several views.The task of the DependencyContainer (DC) like Act1DC is to bundle and keep all dependencies of the respective Act so that they can be assigned easily to the actors of the Scenes via DI.A special dependency is the Factory like Act1Factory. It is responsible for creating new dependencies, e.g. Act2DC as soon as a user-object exists. The Factory also creates new ViewController and therefore Scenes for the Navigator.All Scenes are decoupled from each other by the DC, so that no Scene needs to know anything about another, at least not directly. A Logic must, of course, know well where to navigate, and the Navigator has to know how exactly, but that happens through abstraction thanks to the DC.Acts are not tested themselves, but they are essential to testing the other parts. By preparing special test acts, other dependencies can be mocked and injected for testing purposes.WorkerOnce you can isolate functionality from the app, you should do it and write your own Worker for it. Workers are, therefore, code from the Logic, or the ViewController extracted into classes or frameworks that can be at least theoretically used in other Scenes. Workers are, therefore, not part of a special Scene.Every piece of logic that is not a use case directly bound to a specific Scene should, therefore, be put into an own Worker class.Should the app perform server requests? Then a new worker is needed only for server requests! Caching? Own worker! Databases? New worker! Complicated validation of user input? Worker! \ud83d\ude0aWorkers are specialized helpers that contain logic code and are responsible for only one aspect. Therefore, each Worker should be heavily unit tested.The power of the modularization comes from outsourcing code into Workers. Without Workers, the massive class size problem would only shift to other parts, like to a ViewModel in the MVVM architecture. So, the key here is to divide all code into smaller modules, meaning Workers.ConclusionThe presented approach should serve as an alternative to the common architectures or as an inspiration for an own architecture.I hope that, through this post, I was able to show how modularizing code into Display, Logic and Core leads to a simple structure with Scenes. Workers help to break massive code down. For a more detailed explanation, please read my article \u201cDecoupling Display and Logic in iOS\u201d.For more information about the project structure, with a complex example, read my article \u201cAn example of a scalable iOS Project\u201d. In that article, I also provided some best practices to help increase the maintainability of a project further.By the way, I still lack a reasonable name for this Display-Logic-Core-architecture.

What is VIPER Module ? How should a module be assembled?The BackstoryRecently, as iOS development team we have decided to migrate our project codebase from Objective-C to Swift, also we have discussed the use of a new architecture instead of keeping all stuff in MVC.So, open XCode, select file and new project, choose swift as development language and start over again, right ? \ud83e\udd14Nope, sometimes things are not so that easy. In fact, product managers would not be happy if whole team left new upcoming features as well as sprint goals to work on migration process. Therefore, we had to do both swift migration and common sprint jobs in parallel to make everyone happy. Apple call it Mix and Match, details can be viewed from link below,Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1): Swift and Objective-C in the Same ProjectDescribes various aspects of Swift's compatibility with the Objective-C language and Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks.developer.apple.comHowever this story is not about swift migration, also there are much better articles about it. If we focus on our decision about changing app architecture, what was the reason behind this ?Actually iOS project we have been working on was like a giant spaghetti in a pot that every developer add her/his own sauce to recipe for each new task.So, which features should a good architecture provide?Easily followable data flow.Each object has a clear role separated from others.Easy to test.Truth is, our iOS project is lack of these features clearly.Well, what are signs indicating there is a problem with app architecture ?Massive view controllers with thousands of lines of code.Getting lost while debugging.Increasing number of global variables all along the app.Nearly impossible to test.Not surprisingly, these signs were defining our project. So, we have started to search for different architecture patterns used in iOS, with considering their pros and cons. After lots of reading, we have set a meeting to discuss with each other and make a final decision. At the end of the meeting, everyone seems to be satisfied with an architecture named VIPER to be our next.What is VIPER ?Viper is an architecture that divides a feature implementation into five distinct layer in one module. Each character of VIPER represents a different layer;V: ViewI: InteractorP: PresenterE: EntityR: RouterEach layer has a distinct role in the module. In VIPER, I think implementing a feature like building a lego from different parts. Let\u2019s take a look at each layer,ViewView is a dummy object receiving touch events most of the time. Instead of MVC\u2019s massive view controller with thousands lines of codes, basically all service related codes and decision makings should not exist in it. For example, when a touch event was received from the user, view object should notify the presenter like \u201cMy dear presenter, a touch was received from user and I don\u2019t know what I should do with it\u201dPresenterI think presenter is the heart of the VIPER module. Only layer in the module that communicates with all other layers. Basically all decision makings should be handled in the presenter. After the decision, presenter has to communicate with the layer required. For example, after notified by view with touch event, presenter should decide what should be done next. Does screen need to update it\u2019s UI ? Then tell view layer to update UI with given info. Should a data be fetch from remove server ? Then tell interactor to fetch it. Similarly, does app need to navigate to other screen ? Then tell router to navigate which screen it is.InteractorInteractor contains business logic and it\u2019s mostly responsible from api calls. It builds request from parameters and creates objects by mapping response. After finishing service connection, it notifies presenter like \u201cHey presenter, these are puppies you are looking for\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am not able to fetch your needs at this moment\u201d. You get the idea.RouterYou need segue to another module ? Tell router which module it should be presented next and leave the rest to it. Router needs a UINavigationController instance to do such navigation stuff. Also I think that router should be responsible for showing alerts since UIAlertController is used with present method.EntityPlain data objects mainly driven by interactor. No more, no less.To summarize, what a VIPER module should look like, take a look at the figure below;Figure 1: Basic Viper Module DiagramMeet the Best iOS Demo App EverLet\u2019s convert something implemented in MVC to a viper module step by step. I created a very basic iOS app that consists of 3 screens which are Home, AddressList and AddressDetail. Home and AddressDetail are just dummy screens to provide integrity all around the app.For example, let\u2019s reimplement address list screen with VIPER. (Unit tests are skipped for now to make implementation short). Address list view controller simply presents addresses and if user clicks one of the addresses or add new address on the navigation bar, page navigates to address detail screen.Before start, take a look at the AddressViewControllerAs you can see, making service calls, presenting popups, triggering segues etc all are handled in view controller. It may seem not a problem in this case, however believe me view controller will be getting bigger and bigger in the real world scenario in a similar situation. So, let\u2019s implement it with VIPER.Viper Module ImplementationFirst thing first, we should create layers, like;AddressListView, aka AddressListViewControllerAddressListPresenterAddressListInteractorAddressListRouterAddress as EntityOf course all these layers should move under the folder AddressListModule.Initial AddressList Module Folder StructureLayer InterfacesTo make responsibilities clearer, each layer should apply a protocol to open themselves to other layers, from now on I will call it interface. For example, what does presenter want AddressListView to do ? Most probably it gives an array of address properties which are listed in the screen. Also grouping protocol methods with a comment according to who will use them would be better.Before jump to implementation directly, let\u2019s define interfaces of layers;AddressListView InterfaceAddressListPresenter InterfaceAddressListRouter InterfaceAddressListInteractor InterfaceHow did we write all these ? Answer is simple, thinking about responsibilities of each layer. Just be sure that each layer applies it\u2019s own interface after defining them \ud83d\ude43After interfaces are done, define associated layer variables in each layer considering which layer it should communicate with. You may want to look at the Figure 1 at this moment.Next we should think how we can create the module. Since different modules communicate between their routers, I think router should assemble the whole module. Since it is independent from module\u2019s actual router instance, we can create a static module creation method in AddressListRouter;Module Creation Static MethodAlthough static module creation method in router is just fine for me, I\u2019d like to hear if you have a better idea.Now, we can implement interface methods. Let\u2019s check the AddressListViewController again after implementing methods;AddressListView ImplementationNow you can see that view has no idea what is going on. Each time a user touch event is happened, lifecycle method is called, view tells what happened to presenter instead of doing something itself. Even it does not contain any data related with addresses, it just asks to presenter what will be displayed in the cells while reloading table view. So let\u2019s look at the presenter then;AddressListPresenter ImplementationAs you can see that presenter determines what will happen next and invokes responsible layer. If fetching data is required, it tells to interactor, if the view should be updated, it makes it via view\u2019s interface methods. Similarly, if a navigation stuff is required, it commands router to do it. However no UIKit related operation is allowed here. Also, when view is needed to address data, presenter gives only a part of the necessary properties will be displayed in the screen, it handled with giving tuple to view in the demo project.Let\u2019s look at the interactor;AddressListInteractor ImplementationInteractor is just responsible from service calls in this module. It fetches address list using it\u2019s service property whenever presenter requested. Also if an error occurs, interactor notifies the presenter with associated error message. Although there is no analytics event sending or fetching local data in this module, interactor is responsible from them. At last, router implementation can be seen below;AddressListRouter ImplementationWhenever you present, pop or push something, you should know that it is router\u2019s job. As you can see above, router provides that navigate another view controller, as well as presenting something includes popups. Again, since it is a demo project there is only one module in it, router should communicate with other modules in a real project in terms of navigation.What about other stuff used in the module except layers ?We have used custom cell named AddressListTableViewCell in the view layer to present address data. Also AddressListResponse and Address models are used by interactor layer. Since these files are associated with AddressList module, we should move these files under the module\u2019s folder in the project navigator;AddressList Module Folder StructureFinal WordsAt the end of the story, we created an Viper module step by step. Although implementation of VIPER seems more work needed in first step, adding new capabilities to the layers is really easy thanks to the protocol oriented approach. Following data flow in the debugging is easy too, since each layer has a clear role. In addition to it, even view controller can be testable by using presenter when each life cycle method invoked and each user action happened.However, it would be an overkill for the relatively small projects.One last thing, if you are afraid number of layers that you should create for viper module, you may want to give a chance to script below, which is created by my teammate \ud83d\ude0cCIVIPERGeneratorHappy coding !", "responses": 4, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Swift", "Protocol Oriented", "Mobile Architecture"]}, {"title": "Clean Architecture For iOS Development Using The VIPER Pattern", "post_link": "https://medium.com/slalom-engineering/clean-architecture-for-ios-development-using-the-viper-pattern-fac30f5d29fc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Edward Groberski", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@egroberski", "publish_date": "2018-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-01", "readtime": "6.31", "claps": 195, "voters": 49, "content": "Clean Architecture For iOS Development Using The VIPER PatternEdward GroberskiFollowMay 22, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readPhoto by Zachary Young on UnsplashWhen starting an iOS project, among the first obstacles developers will focus on besides the purpose of the application or what Cocoapods they\u2019ll need will be how they will organize code, and maybe which design patterns will be followed. While most developers will stick to the tried and true MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-View Model), there is a clever pattern called VIPER that many do not know about. VIPER may change the way you\u2019re used to developing for the iOS platform, and like most things, it has positives and negatives.The Usual SuspectWhen first starting with iOS development, developers will hear a lot about MVC or Model-View-Controller. This Apple approved architectural pattern appears everywhere including Apple\u2019s UIKit, most tutorial example apps, and a majority of the apps on the App Store today. Just like the name suggests, MVC is broken down into three responsibilities:Model: The application\u2019s data and logic that manipulates that data.View: The User Interface that the user manipulates.Controller: Controls the logic between the Model and the View.MVC will work just fine if you\u2019re working on your first app or working in a small team, but as the app grows, developers begin to jokingly refer to MVC as \u201cMassive-View-Controller.\u201d As time goes on more and more logic gets shoved into the Controller, and the Controller becomes more bloated and untestable. This is what the VIPER pattern tries to solve.What is VIPER?The VIPER pattern is a Clean Architecture that conforms to the Single Responsibility Principle. VIPER strives to divide the app\u2019s logic into distinct layers of responsibility. Going a couple steps further than MVC, VIPER is broken down into five responsibilities:View: Displays information from the Presenter and sends user interactions back to the Presenter.Interactor: Retrieves Entities and contains the business logic for a particular use case. They are view agnostic and can be consumed by one or many Presenters.Presenter: Handles preparing content for the display and intercepting user interactions.Entity: Simple data model objects.Router: Handles navigation logic for which screens should appear and when.When implementing VIPER, each feature or module will follow the above structure. Since the app\u2019s logic will be separated into smaller components, the views now become lighter and the logic now becomes more testable.The Flow of VIPERThe basic flow of VIPER is fairly straightforward. The user is brought to a new View by the Router, the View notifies the Presenter that it needs data, the Presenter asks the Interactor for data, the Interactor retrieves the Entities (from network request or local database), the Interactor sends the Entities to the Presenter, the Presenter creates View Models from the Entities, the Presenter sends the View Models to the View, and the View displays the necessary data to the user.Implementing VIPERTo demonstrate creating a module in the VIPER pattern, let\u2019s pretend we are creating an app that displays a table of cars. Each cell displays the car\u2019s make and model. The user will have the ability to tap on a cell and see the details of the car, or they can click on a \u201cCreate new car\u201d button to add a new car to the list. When implementing a new module, I find it easier to work bottom-up, so we will start with defining our Entities.EntitySince the app is dealing with cars, let\u2019s create a simple struct object that will hold some basic information: the car object.The car object is what our API service will return to us. It contains basic information like id, make, model, and trim of the car. However, when we want to display information about cars, we do not need to include all of their information since the table cells only need to display the make and model of the car. So, we can create a quick view model to represent just the make and the model of the car.This quick view model will be created in the Presenter and passed back to the View.InteractorNow that our Entities are established, let\u2019s create our business logic or \u201cuse cases\u201d for them. Our table view will need to be populated with cars from an API service. So we will create an Interactor that handles retrieving cars from the API and sending them to the Presenter.To do this, we declare a protocol method called getCars that will use our API service to get the cars and return them. Since our app is pretty simple, we do not need additional use cases (although most real applications have several use cases).PresenterWith the Interactor in place, we now have a way to retrieve cars that we will eventually display. As stated earlier, the Presenter is in charge of reacting to a user\u2019s input and preparing content for the display. Our app\u2019s description mentioned the need to display cars (make and model), the ability to show a car\u2019s details, and the ability to create and add a new car to the table. Next, we will create a Presenter that allows us to do just that.For our ability to show cars, we have added a showCars method that uses our previously created Interactor to retrieve the cars and then create simple View Models from those objects that will be used for specific types of cells within the View. The next two methods, showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen, will use the Router (this will be created next) to navigate the user to the correct screen. These are three methods that our View will use to enable functionality.RouterWhat\u2019s an app without navigation? The next step will be to create a Router that handles navigating a user to different screens depending on the action. So far, our app requires us to navigate to a car detail screen and a create new car screen. Let\u2019s implement those two scenarios now.Our two methods showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen simply instantiate new View Controllers and use a presenting View Controller\u2019s Navigation Controller to push them onto the view stack.ViewNow that we have a way to retrieve cars for display and several means for navigating the user to different screens, our next step is to create a View Controller that relies on the Presenter to handle its content and actions.The first thing we may notice is our View Controller is now extremely light. There is no logic done in our View Controller, just simply calls to the Presenter which delegates what should happen. No more Massive-View-Controller!Testing With VIPERDue to the VIPER pattern\u2019s distinct layers of responsibility, unit testing can be accomplished very easily. Each level can be tested individually without the need to set up complex environments. To demonstrate this, we can test our CarPresenter. This Presenter handles loading car data, showing the car detail screen, and showing the create new car screen. Let\u2019s create some tests.Since we created our Router and Interactor methods with Protocols, we can easily mock those classes for testing purposes. The CarPresenter is then created using those test classes, and within the tests we can easily verify that our expected behavior is correct.The Benefits of VIPERIn the seven months that I used the VIPER pattern, I identified some advantages:Ease of testing: Due to the loosely coupled nature of the VIPER pattern, adding unit tests to every object is simple compared to other patterns.Handles large teams: The project that I used VIPER on had roughly 15 developers. Because of the separation of modules within the pattern, developers can easily work on different parts of the app without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. Using VIPER also helps to reduce merge conflicts.Ease of development: Once the project is fully set up on VIPER, it becomes easier to add a new feature to a module. If you need a new way to sort something, you can add a new method in the Presenter. Developers can couple the VIPER pattern with Dependency Injection to add new features quickly and easily.The Negatives of VIPERWhile the VIPER pattern might help eliminate Massive-View-Controllers, it does come at a price.Too much boilerplate code: As you can see in the examples above, a lot of template code needs to be created to create a simple application. This can slow down development in the beginning and add unneeded complexity. The increase of files can also add to the compile time.High learning curve: Due to the increase complexity of VIPER over MVC, the team might need more discussion and training on to properly implement the pattern across their application.Full buy-in: In my experience, the whole project needs to use the VIPER pattern. VIPER does not play nicely with Massive-View-Controllers, partially implemented VIPER modules, third party Cocoapods that do not use VIPER, and even Apple\u2019s own frameworks. When using VIPER with existing code or new frameworks, extra work is required to ensure code compatibility.ConclusionAlthough the world of iOS development is tightly coupled to MVC, the benefits of using the VIPER pattern in iOS development can be transformational for the right kinds of projects and teams. I\u2019d recommend evaluating the VIPER pattern for larger projects and teams who are looking to reduce conflicts, increase test coverage, and separate their code responsibility more cleanly.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["iOS", "Mobile App Development", "Software Architecture", "Design Patterns", "App Development"]}, {"title": "Clean architecture for iOS (VIPER/VIP)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saad.eloulladi/clean-architecture-for-ios-viper-vip-c19de40b71e2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Saad El Oulladi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saad.eloulladi", "publish_date": "2019-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-13", "readtime": "9.71", "claps": 271, "voters": 34, "content": "Clean architecture for iOS (VIPER/VIP)Saad El OulladiFollowApr 22 \u00b7 10 min readDuring the last years, the mobile software industry has grown at a remarkable rate. Mobile applications were mainly small and contained generally few screens. While now they became gigantic, with a UI and business logic so complex.In addition to testability issues faced with regular MVC architecture. The well known massive view controller problem made people look for an alternative to be able to scale well mobile applications.Then Clean architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) started gaining interest by the mobile community. Searching for a better separation of concerns, and less coupling in the application codebase.Clean architecture is an abstract concept which is not related to a given technology or language. Taking the special context of the mobile into account, people at first were not sure how to apply it on iOS. So Conrad Stoll came with VIPER in his article \u201cArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPER\u201d. Which was the first architecture on iOS inspired by uncles bob clean architecture.After that, Raymond Law suggested VIP architecture in his blog as an improvement of VIPER, criticised for not being fully aligned with clean architecture principles.What is exactly the benefit of adopting Clean architecture ? what makes VIP different from VIPER ? And is VIP really a an improvement over VIPER ? let\u2019s try to demystify all this step by step.Whats is CleanBefore talking about iOS implementations (VIPER and VIP). Let\u2019s discover first first the Clean Architecture concept itself. And what are the benefits that it brings in a software in general.Clean architecture helps to address the following issues :Code becomes too dependent to frameworks.Whether it\u2019s the UI or database. When you have your code mixed with the framework related part. you are obliged to follow the technical implementation. while with clean architecture , we isolate all frameworks related code in a separate layer.Usually when you have an issue or you want to modify something, it\u2019s hards to find the related code, to you need to pend lot of time searching. While clean architecture provides a good separation of concerns so is much easier to find something in your code.Clean architecture helps to isolate business logic in one layer, instead of having it spread all over the code.When all the application is done as one big module, its parts becomes too coupled to each other. But with clean architecture, the application should be split into multiples modules, which makes creating random dependencies very hard.Due to the separation from frameworks, Unit tests becomes much easier.Clean architecture layersWhenever you read about Clean architecture. You will find the above diagram. each circle represents a layer that should be separated in the course code :Entity : plain objects, representing the enterprise business rules, they can be a structure of data or a set of methods. they are meant to be shared by all the enterprise applications.Use case : Represents the business logic specific to the application, it can make use one or more entities.Interface Adapter : the role of this layer is to transform the data given by the use case, from a raw data structure the most convenient format for the final usage, whether it\u2019s a UI, web or database.Framework layer : This is where the use of data is concretised, Mainly when applied to the mobile context , we are talking about the view.The Dependency RuleAn important rule about this architecture, which is indicated by the arrows pointing inward the circle : Is that every layer, should know nothing about the layer in the top of it.For instance the entities should have no reference of use cases. and so on.Screaming architectureAnother important principle of clean architecture to take into account is the so called \u201cScreaming architecture\u201d.What it means in short is that when you look at an application structure, you should get an idea of what the application actually does, rather than seeing technical details.In other words, the parent application source code folders should be grouped by features. And inside each feature folder, you find the structure related to the technical architecture you are using.Now that we talked about clean architecture in general, let\u2019s have a look at its implementations on iOS.VIPER architectureThe first attempt to apply clean architecture on iOS was VIPER.No it\u2019s not a reference to the venomous snake \ud83d\udc0d. But it stands for (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router).Notice that here we don\u2019t talk about the viewController. this is because it\u2019s considered as a view. And mainly the goal here is to spread the code that used to be in the viewController all over VIPER components :Entity : Simply the data model (mainly structs in Swift).Interactor : This is the equivalent of (Use case) in clean architecture. And this is where the business logic should be. it\u2019s also responsible of getting data, whether rough network calls or database queries.Presenter : This is the central piece of VIPER architecture. The equivalent of Interface Adapter in clean architecture. It does two major tasks : Transforming data (into view models) to be used by the view & to intercept UI actionsView : As we just said above, what we mean by the view here is both view and view controllers. The important rule to keep in mind is to avoid doing business logic on it.Remember \u201cOnly UI code\u201dRouter : is responsible of moving from a screen to another. This makes navigation code testable and easy to find. Hence all routers should have a reference on the current navigationController. This component does not exist in the original clean code principle as defined by Uncle Bob. This is because screens navigation mechanism here is quite specific to the mobile and iOS in particular.Structure of VIPER moduleThe above diagram shows how VIPER components are related to each other. It\u2019s important to put strong and weak references in the right place to avoid having retain cycles.Note that components are linked through interfaces , and each one has a protocol defining it\u2019s behaviour.Note also that only the view and the router should import UIKit, this way we make sure to have no dependency to the UI among the rest of VIPER module.Builders and WorkersThe above structure represents the core logic of VIPER architecture. you might find elsewhere, people using some extra components like Builders or Workers.Builder (Sometimes also called Configurator) : Instead of initialising all VIPER parts inside Appdelegate or a previous Routers. we can use a class called builder to put all init code for a module. usually it has no properties, only a static class that builds viper module around the view (viewController)Worker : For instance, Interactor class is managing data from different sources, let\u2019s say we have a rest API and a local database to use for offline mode. Then we can make a worker class for each data source, this will reduce the size of our Interactor and will allow us to reuse our workers later in if needed.Let\u2019s have some practice.This is a one page app to buy magic candies.The user set the candies quantity. And at the bottom we display the total price and the price including taxes according to the quantity.First we defined a CandyEntity with the base data structure we need.Notice that we are using protocols to define the behaviour of each component, in order to have contracts we can use without needing to know anything else about each other. and in order to b e able to replace easily components.And an api worker simulating a web service call to get data as CandyEntity object.The next layer will be our Interactor. It owns an instance of the APIworker which it will get the data from.The Interactor has two methods :Fetch candy model using our ApiWorker.And another which is called when ever we update the quantity.And all your business logic is happening in the Interactor, since it\u2019s here where we calculate the actual price, and we pass it with all the other informations including the Tax to the presenter.Here in Presenter layer we have two types of methods :fetchCandy and updateCandyQuantity : Both are targeted from the view. both are handling UI actions, (candy view loading and add new candy)The other methods are constructing the data we will forward to view to be displayed.Note here that we are not passing the model to the view, Since the model has more way properties than the view needs actually. we pass instead a version of the model which is dedicated to the view. \u201cviewModel\u201d not to confuse with the MVVM viewModelAnd finally the view is is linked to the presenter in a bidirectional way.On one hand we have the presenter property, and on an other we have the CandyViewProtocol where the view receives data from the presenter.It\u2019s important here to note also that we are not talking about a viewController, but about a view, since in VIPER both are considered the same.Once all our our components ready, we bind them each other in a class called builder.Here is the final VIPER project.What\u2019s wrong with VIPER architectureWhen understanding how VIPER really works, we may think that single responsibility principle could not be better applied, and we could not get more structured. Although VIPER was for a long time the ultimate clean architecture application on iOS. Years of intensive use of VIPER has proven, that it\u2019s far from being perfect. Here\u2019s why :When we Zoom on the bidirectional relationship between the view and the presenter, we figure out that this last is doing two things :1 preparing data for the view.2 managing UI action.Actually, this is not really conform with single responsibility principle. In a way that the presenter itself ends up doing too much stuff when having a big project. While separation of concerns was the reason we avoided MVC in the first place.\u201cIt may seem convenient for the view controller to ask the presenter directly to format a string. But over time, you\u2019ll end up with a mess in your dependency graph\u201d\u2014 \u2018Raymond Law\u2019VIP as an improvement VIPER.Then Raymond Law came with an other logic to face that issue. He intended to apply Clean architecture on iOS in an other way.When i first heard about VIP, i thought to myself why would someone come up with a new architecture. Isn\u2019t VIPER complex enough ? \ud83e\udd14. In the third and last part of this article , we will try to answer this question.VIP doesn\u2019t mean a (Very Important Person). but it\u2019s for (ViewController, Interactor, Presenter). Unlike the other architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER\u2026). VIP name does not refer to its components. because VIP has actually the same components as VIPER. but the V \u2014 I \u2014 P is a reference to the components that make its particularity. ViewController, Interactor and Presenter are related and interact differently in VIP architecture (In that order !!).When we take a look at VIP structure. we notice the following points :View Controller is not considered anymore as View. As we had in VIPER. They are completely separated.ViewController is now the master piece instead of the presenter. It has a connection to all the other the other componentsWe don\u2019t have anymore the bidirectional link between ViewController and Presenter, like in VIPER. We have now circular flow of data, ViewController > Interactor > Presenter.Actually this circular data flow is what makes VIP an improvement over VIPER. In other words. instead of having the presenter handling UI actions and preparing data for the view. ViewController now passes the requests to the interactor, which has all business logic on it, and sends the result as a raw data to the presenter. which transforms it to the appropriate format (usually to ViewModels), which then sends it back to the viewController to be displayed.The advantage with this circular data flow is that each component can now focus on doing only one thing.VIP in practice.Now since the viewController is the central piece :It has a presenter , interactor and router properties.The viewController is passing UI actions directly to the interactor.The presenter is now lighter with only presentation data construction methods.And we can see the new architecture through the builder class knowing that all parts are now connected to the view controller.Here is the final VIP Demo project.ConclusionIn the same way that clean code architectures can make a big project well organised and structured. We should always keep in mind that implementing them the wrong way will lead to the opposite effect. that means if implemented without being aware of their technical details can only make the project messy and complex.An other point to take into account is the project scale. in many cases when having a small application with no business logic, MVC or MVP is more than enough.Always remember that there is no architecture that matches all the cases.Sure in the future, more new architectures will appear with new enhancements, this is how things evolve. Till then let\u2019s keep our architectures clean. \ud83d\ude0aThank you for reading. \ud83d\udc4dOriginally published in My Blog : SaadElOulladi.comReferences :https://medium.com/slalom-engineering/clean-architecture-for-ios-development-using-the-viper-pattern-fac30f5d29fchttps://theswiftdev.com/2018/03/12/the-ultimate-viper-architecture-tutorial/https://github.com/raywenderlich/SC_SusmitaHorrow/wiki/Clean-Architecture-for-iOShttps://medium.com/@piyush.dez/ios-architectures-5a19cd56edc2https://swifting.io/blog/2016/09/07/architecture-wars-a-new-hope/", "responses": 1, "tags": ["iOS", "VIP", "Viper", "Swift", "Clean Architecture"]}, {"title": "The VIPER architecture", "post_link": "https://medium.com/swift-coding/the-viper-architecture-1a9dc140c505?source=search_post", "author_name": "Steven Curtis", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc", "publish_date": "2019-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-11-14", "readtime": "4.20", "claps": 25, "voters": 14, "content": "The VIPER architectureIs this the best choice for your needs?Steven CurtisFollowNov 14 \u00b7 5 min readA real life Viper! image from @dermatz_fotografie at unsplash.comThe call it an implementation of the clean architecture to iOS Apps. Here is a discussion about how VIPER can work.A diagram representing the VIPER architecturePrerequisites:Some understanding of OO terminology and practicesTerminologyView: Use the data sent by the presenter, and display it. Can also pass touch events, but will simply notify the presenter of this, where the work to process the touch takes place. In practice the view sets up the presenter (owns it), and sends messages to the same.Interactor: Bidirectionally interacts with the presenter to receive inputs, fetch data, perform complex calculations, the results of which are displayed to the user through the interactor. The Interactor can communicate with a DataManager (the component responsible for fetching data from the network), based on the translated user input fed by the Interactor. In practice the Interactor can get data from a webservice.Presenter: Interacts directly with the view and the interactor. Responsible for taking user inputs from the view, and transferring them to the interactor. Presenter changes the type of the data, if the Interactor requires the data in a specific format. In practice the modules communicate through the presenters.Entity: The model representation of the data.Router: Routes the App to the appropriate screen. The router has to have a direct reference to the viewcontroller, with the presenter acting as an intermediary between view and router.The goal:Provide a clear data flow, with objects that have a distinct role and is easy to test.Goals:\u2014To make the structure modular\u2014 To build applications on the Single responsibility principle\u2014 To reduce the load and dependency on controllers\u2014 To build the App on a behaviour basisDisadvantages:Communication between objects can be convoluted and complicated. Without care, modules can become too large and do too many things. This violates the single responsibility principle!views are important! image from @pawelskor at unsplash.comImplementationThe interactor gets some data from an API, and passes the data to the presenter which then passes the formatted data to the view.Here is an in-depth bullet-point list for the VIPER architecture.View (view controller)creates routerRouter (wireframe)Performs segues and therefore looks after viewscreates presenterBinds the presenter to the viewcreates interactorbinds the interactor to viewbinds the interactor and the presenterInteractorWhen data is fetched, informs the presenter through closuresPresenterhas functions that are called by the interactor, and informs the view controller through the delegate pattern.Performs anything to make the data in a format that the view can easily displayA real-life presenter.

Which will make your life easier\u2026The SOLID principlesGreat for Test Driven Development (TDD), where you write the tests before the application code. This is partly because the architecture helps you to separate your code, and make good predictions about where code should go.Because of these disadvantages it can actually mean that it is slower to ship code. However, the code is likely to be better and more maintainable.Modules are loosly coupled so it is easy to test the modules seperately.Is good for large teams because the modules are separate. This means that there are fewer merge conflicts and issues.Conformity of structure means that it is faster to read other people\u2019s code, and the individual files are smaller than those in MVC meaning the logic is clearer and the overall stability and flexibility of the project is higher. This conformity means that cross-platform code reviews with Android teams are even possible!DisadvantagesModules should communicate by the presenters. One way to handle this is ViperMcFlurry to assist with intermodule data transfer, as it is complex with method swizzling engaged (but obviously this is quite tricky).Even UBER (one of the more famous users of the VIPER architecture) don\u2019t use all of the files in VIPER, and use RIBS instead (router, Interactor and builder)!The Uber engineering blog has a tag for VIPER. Seen at: eng.uber.comVIPER can be seen as overengineered. We need 4 classes to make a very simple app to pass data from a API. All of these files are also recreated with testing, and it makes it very tricky and adds to difficulties in readability.Often there are issues in that you would usually create the initial architecture skeleton first and then develop the modules. There are scripts that can do that for us.The architecture is still relatively young, and this makes it tricky to get developers who are used to using this architecture.Unanswered questionsHow do you split the business and representation logic between interactor and presenter?How can you split third-party SDKs into a Viper paradigm?Have you own unanswered questions?Hit me up!Steven CurtisThe latest Tweets from Steven Curtis (@stevenpcurtis).

However, the Red Wings weren\u2019t the only Detroit/Michigan hockey team I had a special place in my heart for. I was kind of a die-hard Detroit Vipers fan for a long time.The Vipers had a couple of really cool things going for them. First, the name and the jersey. I mean, come on. Too cool.They played at the Palace of Auburn Hills which was only about 15 minutes from my house and was actually a really nice arena during the time they played there.During pre-game introductions they came out of a huge inflatable snake mouth filled with smoke. By far the coolest entrance of any hockey team.Tickets were cheap. Even now I think I can count on one hand the number of Detroit Red Wing games I have seen in person. I must\u2019ve seen the Vipers 10\u201315 times over the course of a few years.One of my teammate\u2019s dad was the head coach of the Vipers. To me, the Vipers were just as impressive as the Red Wings. They were professional hockey players who played in front of thousands of fans every single game. The fact that I got to hang out with someone I considered a legitimate celebrity was pretty cool.My favorite memory of the Vipers, though, didn\u2019t even involve going to an actual game. Instead, I distinctly remember listening to them play in the Turner Cup finals on a little radio while I laid in bed. They must\u2019ve been playing a team out west because I remember it being pretty late. I think the game went into overtime, too. I can\u2019t remember if it was game seven or just the fourth win. All I know is that the Vipers won the game and were therefore Turner Cup champions!It felt anti-climactic to lay in bed while my 2nd favorite hockey team had just won a championship so I got out of bed and walked through the dark and quiet house (my parents and all my brothers were asleep) and whisper cheered.Man, I miss the Vipers.Game NotesI doubt there is anybody my age or a little bit earlier who can watch the Red Wings play the Devils and not have painful flashbacks to the mid-90\u2019s and the absolutely devastating experiences we had playing that team. Not only did we get swept in the 1995 finals after dominating the regular season, but we got swept by a team playing the most boring hockey in the world. It seems unlikely that a play style that existed 22 years ago is still alive in this year\u2019s incarnation of the team, but I swear the Devils are always the most boring team. Always.What really stood out to me in this game was how much trouble the Wings have with breaking out of their own zone. Any team with a halfway competent forecheck gives us absolute fits on the breakout. There were a couple points in the game where we spent the entire shift in our own zone just wrapping the puck along the boards, behind the net, and then getting into a scrum at the hashmarks before whipping it around the boards again. I swear to god there was one shift where that happened 4 times in a row.This game was boring forever and then it wasn\u2019t! Mantha scored! Which is lucky for him because he still looked lethargic and lame as hell out there. It\u2019s interesting to see the power that a goal can have on the momentum of the game, though. Mantha\u2019s goal *was* pretty lucky but it didn\u2019t matter. We came out afterward and actually had some jump in our step.Booth had himself a season tonight. Good for him.Jensen must have had the fastest emotional rollercoaster of all time on the OT goal. He went from thinking he was springing the forwards on a 2-on-1 the other way to putting it directly on the tape of the opposing team in less than a second. That can\u2019t feel good.The Wings scrounge up another point by losing in OT, falling to 10\u20139\u20135 on the season.

Learn more about VIPER here.When Kyle Kersey wants to describe his research, he finds it difficult to delve into the intricacies of coordination, solubility and steric effects. So he\u2019s settled on a different tactic.\u201cThe word I like to use is \u2018humbling,\u2019\u201d Kersey says. In the lab, he works to synthesize new radioactive compounds, and the reactions don\u2019t always proceed as planned. In fact, they rarely ever do.\u201cIt\u2019s never going to work the first time. You should be concerned if it does,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause then you have to figure out how to do it again. I feel like I\u2019ve done it the same way 10,000 times and it never gives me the same result twice.\u201dKersey is a rising junior in VIPER studying chemical and biomolecular engineering in Penn Engineering and chemistry in Penn\u2019s School of Arts & Sciences. He conducts research with uranium and thorium in the lab of Eric Schelter, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry in Arts & Sciences.Even though uranium was discovered centuries ago, scientists still don\u2019t understand much about its highest oxidation state, uranium(VI), in which each atom is missing six electrons. Kersey is trying to create a compound with a double bond between uranium(VI) and carbon, which hasn\u2019t been done before. It\u2019s a challenging synthetic problem.\u201cUranium tends to prefer really \u2018hard\u2019 donors like nitrogen and oxygen,\u201d Kersey says, referring to elements that easily lend their negatively-charged electrons to the positively-charged uranium.Carbon, in comparison, is a \u201csoft\u201d donor. It\u2019s not as generous with its electrons, so it\u2019s difficult for carbon to form a stable bond with uranium. For Kersey, that means trying many different ways of coercing the molecules into forming the product he wants.\u201cSo much of it is trial and error,\u201d Kersey says.Eventually, his work could help improve the storage of spent nuclear fuel. In nuclear reactors, uranium(VI) bonds with two oxygen atoms to form uranyl, a byproduct of energy generation.\u201cThe problem is that uranyl is very water soluble,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cWhen we store nuclear waste in cladding and bury it deep underground, the cladding can crack under various weather conditions.\u201dAs uranyl is both toxic and radioactive, this poses an issue for its long-term storage.\u201cIt leaches into the groundwater and you have radioactive contamination,\u201d Kersey says.Learning more about the chemistry of uranium(VI) could help scientists tailor the reaction to form a byproduct that\u2019s not as water soluble and therefore poses less of a threat to the environment.But for Kersey, the real draw is finding the right combination of reagents, solvents and techniques to create his desired product.\u201cThis specific compound is novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new, challenging synthetic build. That\u2019s really interesting.\u201dKersey is no stranger to the lab bench. He\u2019s also working on two other synthesis projects in Schelter\u2019s lab, both involving thorium. And thanks to Michio Kaku, a well-known futurist and theoretical physicist, he worked on three different projects in two separate labs before even coming to Penn.The two met at an interview and dinner event honoring Kaku in Louisville, Kentucky, where Kersey grew up. He was a freshman in high school at the time.They were talking for a little bit, Kersey says, when Kaku asked him if his high school offered any mentoring partnerships with the University of Louisville for students interested in research. Kersey didn\u2019t think so, but he was intrigued by the possibility of working in a lab before college. Luckily, the dean of Louisville\u2019s Speed School of Engineering also happened to be at the event, and Kersey approached him with the idea.\u201cSo that\u2019s how I got started in the physics department doing optics work,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cI stayed there for about two years until my interests started to shift more toward chemistry and chemical engineering.\u201dIn the Schelter lab, Kersey works with depleted uranium. It\u2019s not as potent as natural or enriched uranium, but still requires some precautions. His workstation, known as a glove box, is an enclosed cabinet with a thick window. Two large black rubber gloves integrated into the window allow him to carry out his experiments. Since thickly gloved hands don\u2019t allow for much precision, he first had to learn to use a pair of long tweezers to grasp small glass vials and thin pipettes.It took him several weeks to figure out a technique that worked, which was made more difficult by the fact that glove boxes are designed for right-handed people (he\u2019s left-handed). Now, he can move materials deftly around the box and carry out his experiments with ease.Following his graduation from Penn, Kersey hopes to pursue a Ph.D. in nuclear science and engineering.\u201cI\u2019ve always been really fascinated with nuclear energy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is amazing to be able to take this mineral from the earth and create so much energy out of it.\u201dKersey credits the VIPER intensive summer research experience with accelerating both his lab skills and chemical understanding.He describes developing a \u201cphysical intuition,\u201d and explains that he can now figure out which chemicals to use even if he doesn\u2019t know the more complex details of their interactions.\u201cWhen you get the trial by fire over the summer, it helps,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cYou form a sense of comfort that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to have in my case, as a rising junior with two semesters of organic chemistry and that\u2019s it.\u201dAfter two summers, a spring semester and countless hours in the lab, he looks forward to his fourth and final VIPER research experience next year. He ultimately hopes to publish his work, but that\u2019s not what keeps him coming back to the lab every day. Instead, he\u2019s driven by the synthetic challenge and the opportunity to advance scientific knowledge.\u201cYou will have an impact regardless of the end result,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have done the work and you\u2019ve contributed something to field. That\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Science", "Engineering", "Chemistry", "Nuclear", "STEM"]}, {"title": "Twitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text Files", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@adron/twitz-coding-session-in-go-cobra-viper-cli-for-parsing-text-files-9d8efce09e77?source=search_post", "author_name": "Adron Hall", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@adron", "publish_date": "2018-12-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-29", "readtime": "3.20", "claps": 5, "voters": 1, "content": "Twitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text FilesAdron HallFollowDec 6, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readPart 1 of 3 \u2014 Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text Files, Retrieval of Twitter Data, Exports to various file formats, and export to Apache Cassandra.UPDATED PARTS:Twitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text Files (this post)Twitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI with Initial Twitter + Cassandra InstallationTwitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI Wrap Up + Twitter Data RetrievalUpdated links to each part will be posted at bottom of this post when I publish them.

Purchase Viper Wine here.\u2014 \u2014  Venetia stayed late abed that morning.This was uncharacteristic, but she found she could not rise.Perhaps she was still angry about the spoiling of the apples. Mistress Elizabeth had not directed the farmhands to it and three barrels at least had been left to mulch. She shouted at her, and then she went to her room and cried. For what? For mouldered apples?Yesterday she was in her knot garden at the front of the house, clipping the box-hedges using her dainty silver shears \u2014 play-gardening, as Kenelm called it \u2014 when a youth in the livery of the Earl of Dorset arrived. She put down her basket and smiled her famous smile at the livery boy, the smile Ben Jonson had written a sonnet about, and Peter Oliver painted; the smile that was so much in demand that a royal writ was put out to send any unlicensed copyist to prison, and still copies came. She stood there, her hip askew, so confident, the breeze in her flowing hair, her loose country dress full and soft. \u201cMadam,\u201d said the boy, bowing like a silly sapling, then looking her full in the face. \u201cCould you tell me where to find her most gracious beauty Venetia, Lady Digby?\u201dHe was holding a tall fair lily \u2014 a gallant reference, she supposed, to the single fleur-de-lis on Kenelm\u2019s coat of arms \u2014 and aflame with nerves and excitement, he glanced back and forth at the house, as if he thought the great dame herself might at any moment appear in a cloud of golden light.Venetia laughed it off and said, \u201cWhy, that lady is before you.\u201d And as the youth looked at her with disbelief, and as his face turned from disappointment to, yes, repulsion, she remembered, as she had to keep remembering, that she was no longer herself. Her teeth were going, though they were always so good, and she had not yet learned to smile without showing them. She saw, in the mirror of his face, as the young boy\u2019s pupils shrank, how much she had changed. And still he did not present her with the lily. Did he think she was a presuming and ironical chambermaid, testing him?Edward Sackville must have talked up her beauty to his livery boy. It was his way. Since he became an earl his talk carried more weight. The boy had been expecting a treat: to see the woman with the smallest waist in London. Once that had been almost true. Now . . . \u201cHave you no mouth to keep your tongue in, or do you stand there like a dimmock?\u201d she snapped. As she heard herself speak, she felt ashamed. This is what it is, she realised, to become bitter, to spit out rude gall because your bones are turned to brittleness. She turned and took off her embroidered gardening gloves, while her rage subdued, and then she reached out and took the boy\u2019s hand, as if it belonged to her.\u201cForgive me,\u201d she said, leading him inside the house to her drawing room, intending, by allowing him into her feminine bower, and by spending a short time asking him questions about his life and opinions, to make him adore her for ever. But after their spiced cup arrived, and she had poured it, she went upstairs to fetch her fan, and while she was looking for the fan, she found an old keepsake from Sir Kenelm, and soon she became unaccountably sleepy. It was already dark when she awoke, remembering the boy downstairs, who had vanished, leaving that long, drooping lily beside her cold cup of spiced wine.Venetia was surprised at herself. She knew she was voluble and impatient, and many men found her too bold \u2014 except Sir Kenelm, who loved her strength \u2014 but she was not usually careless enough to abandon a young boy so thoughtlessly. But sometimes carelessness is a way of getting out of what we cannot do. She had always thrived on company. Now she was beginning to conceive a dread of daylight.No wonder she went out veiled these days. It was a necessary precaution. She wiggled her toes in the cambric bed-sheet, to check she was still alive. \u201cThe rising sun / Which once I saw / Is now high in the heaven.\u201d She often made up madrigals about nothing at all, just to make her thoughts musical. She really ought to rise. Chater must have led matins without her. She would tell him she had been at private prayer.What was it Dr. Donne preached, which had so affected her? They went to so many funerals she could not remember whose it was where Donne had looked so thin and shrunken standing in the pulpit, his voice so slow that as he began a new sentence, one feared he might not live to finish it. And yet the light and dark began to mingle in his speaking, and promise answered question, so that questions died away, and on the flow of his speech he carried them, speaking so kindly, so privately to the very heart of each of them, until all were moved to glad wet tears, and the inverse of the doctor\u2019s face, black-skulled, with bone-white burning holes for eyes, remained imprinted on her mind\u2019s eye even now.Her pillow book was buried in the covers beside her, and she turned to the page where she had copied down that delicious passage: \u201cThat which we call life is but Hebdomada Mortium, a week of death, seven days, seven periods of our life spent in dying, dying seven times over. Our birth dies in infancy, and our infancy dies in youth, and so forth, until age dies and determines all.\u201dRipeness, she thought, is but the first sign of rot; there is no rest to be had anywhere on this planet. Since it turns, and turns, how can we ever be still? Sir Kenelm had the blame for that. He was the first to tell her that the earth was a hazelnut tossed in the air.She could feel a new coarsening in her hair, which Kenelm had always stroked and made her laugh by telling her that the Greeks said a soft-haired creature was a soft-hearted one. Throwing back her blankets, like pulling off a plaister, Venetia considered her famous feet, once described by one of James I\u2019s Scots poets as \u201cwing\u00e8d dreams, each toe a wish,\u201d splayed out fat and graceless on the counterpane. In private she sometimes made horrid faces in the glass, and wobbled her puckered thighs, deliberately tormenting herself. This morning she could not be bothered even to do that.Ageing is imperceptible. It happens as gradually as a stone staircase wears, or a fan kept in sunlight fades. But to Venetia it had happened slowly and then suddenly, like a huge stock of water drains for a long time, hardly depleted, till the last swills vanish quickly.I can bear it, she thought, because my husband bears it. He sees beyond the skin. He has deeper vision than most men. Why else would he love me, spoiled as I am? Each day we remain here together, before we go to town, we become more like a family, and he and I grow close again. We kiss each other every night; we wake together every morning. To my love, my husband, I am like a tree he sits beneath; he does not perceive my leaves a-turning.Every day, the lowing cows in the valley told her it was almost noon, and every day their lowing seemed to come round faster.

Team Canada was being led by a budding NHL prospect by the name of John Tavares. His poise, speed and skill was on display in volumes, every single night. He brought me up out of my seat multiple times, including his hat-trick against the rival United States team. Overall, he exploded in the tournament for 15 points in only 6 games and was easily handed the Tournament\u2019s Most Valuable Player trophy.Some months later, at the NHL Draft, he was selected 1st overall by the New York Islanders. He went on to have a solid rookie campaign, totaling 54 points over a complete season of 82 games. The next two seasons, he followed up with 67 and 81 points respectively. After the lockout of 2012, in the shortened season of 47 games, he actually topped the point-a-game measure, with 48 points. To this day (including last season) his career totals in the NHL are 537 points in only 587 games (0.92 points per game). If those aren\u2019t \u201csuperstar\u201d numbers, I don\u2019t know what are.Tavares was named Captain of the Islanders in 2013, deservedly. He has led them in every statistical category since his entry into the league. He has also led what has been, in very recent history, been a rather poor hockey team into the playoffs a few times. It\u2019s obvious to see that he\u2019s led the franchise by example, \u201cdriving the bus\u201d so to say.NHL.com / Cory WrightPreviously, the organization\u2019s struggling ownership could have caused him to re-think his status on The Island, or to re-evaluate what\u2019s been a perennially poor supporting cast. But in 2017\u201318, things may just be taking a turn for the better for the young man, starting with the addition of former World Juniors teammate Jordan Eberle this offseason. With an influx of young talent like Josh Ho-Sang and Mat Barzal, this team may in fact be fighting for a playoff spot down the stretch run.When it comes to the media, John certainly isn\u2019t the most spoken about athlete\u2026 until this year, when he\u2019ll draw plenty of attention with his contract running out in New York. Speculation will likely attempt to link him to Toronto, being he is from Mississauga and grew up a Maple Leafs fan. However, for cap reasons, that scenario is highly unlikely. Another market that would love to have his skills would be Montreal. But my sense is that Tavares does not want to play in a large market. He seems to enjoy his anonymity somewhat. I think he will either stay on Long Island, the lesser demanding market of the two \u201cNew York\u201d teams, or move to a Western Conference team like San Jose or Anaheim, where he can continue to put up numbers and slip under the radar of hockey media.Tavares is definitely one of my favorite players to watch. His skills, shot and hockey sense make him an elite player in the NHL. I only wish his star shone brightly enough for more fans to take notice of him. I, for one, will always route for John Tavares (except of course when he plays my favorite team and his hometown team, the Maple Leafs) to succeed in the NHL. Only time, and his continued skill, will tell if that rings true.See you on the ice!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Sports", "NHL", "Hockey", "2017 Nhl Preview", "John Tavares"]}, {"title": "The Golden Knights Display Their Strength", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@BigLee13/the-golden-knights-display-their-strength-da78f13b310?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lee Vyner", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@BigLee13", "publish_date": "2017-10-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-14", "readtime": "3.20", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "The Golden Knights Display Their StrengthAmid the #VegasStrong movement, the NHL\u2019s newest franchise put on a fascinating show before and during their home opener.Lee VynerFollowOct 19, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readNHL.comIt was an emotional evening in Las Vegas last Tuesday evening, as thousands of fans poured into the T-Mobile Arena in anticipation of the Vegas Golden Knights inaugural home opener. To most\u2019s surprise, up to that point, the team had already won their first two games (on the road nonetheless) on the backs of James Neal and Marc-Andre Fleury. But that\u2019s just the \u201chockey\u201d aspect of it.But the magic truly appeared during the pregame ceremony, when the time came for them to address the crowd and the city, in the wake of what is now identified as the largest mass shooting in American history.If you didn\u2019t get to witness it, picture this: The lights dimmed. The players made their way to the ice from the dressing room. Then, before each player, coach and manager was introduced in turn, a first responder was introduced along with them. The engaged and emotional crowd stood and cheered loudly for the collection. The Golden Knights opponent that evening, the Arizona Coyotes, stood with the team on the blue line for the singing of the national anthem. At the ceremonial puck drop, there were actual survivors of the terror attack present to join team captains, Oliver Ekman-Larrson of the Coyotes and James Neal of the Knights.Golden Knights defenseman, Deryk Engelland, who lives full time in Las Vegas, addressed the crowd. He reminded them he was proud to call the city his home, that he met his wife in Vegas and that his children were born there. He completed his presentation with what is a now famous statement, as evidenced by a widely-used hashtag, that everyone there was \u201cVegas Strong.\u201d After the ceremonial puck drop, there was a 58-second moment of silence held, one second for every victim. As the lights rose, you could see that all advertisements on the boards had been replaced with the same statement, \u201cVegas Strong\u201d.Then, it was game time, where it did not take long for the fans to come to their feet and cheer. Only 2:30 into the game, on a sweet feed from Peirre-Edouard Bellemar, Tomas Nosek potted an awesome goal, causing the roof to come off the arena. That was just the beginning of the onslaught. After less than six minutes of game time, the Golden Knights were up 3 goals (Deryk Engelland and James Neal also scored later) and had chased Coyotes goalie Antti Raanta practically out of Nevada.Before the first period had finished, the Golden Knights had lit the lamp four times. The game wrapped up with another Vegas victory of 5\u20132, making history as the first NHL expansion team to start a season 3\u20130\u20130. James Neal finished with another 2-goal performance and Fleury made 31 saves in yet a winning effort.Even though history was made during the 60 minutes of \u201cice time,\u201d the true story, and the one we will always remember, was and should be, the classy ceremony displayed by the Vegas Golden Knights during that sentimental pregame portion. Remember to always be Vegas Strong!Lets hope the games are always that exciting!Oh, and perhaps worth noting that after that game, James Neal had scored as many goals as the entire Montreal Canadiens team!

Just the standard rocking tune.3:40 A quick recap. Check out the previous write \u201cTwitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text Files\u201d of this series.4:30 Beginning of completion of twitz parse command for exporting out to XML, JSON, and CSV (already did the text export previous session). This segment also includes a number of refactorings to clean up the functions, break out the control structures and make the code more readable.In the end of refactoring twitz parse came out like this. The completed list is put together by calling the buildTwitterList() function which is actually in the helpers.go file. Then prints that list out as is, and checks to see if a file export should be done. If there is a configuration setting set for file export then that process starts with a call to exportParsedTwitterList(exportFilename string, exportFormat string, ... etc ... ). Then a simple single level control if then else structure to determine which format to export the data to, and a call to the respective export function to do the actual export of data and writing of the file to the underlying system. There\u2019s some more refactoring that could be done, but for now, this is cleaned up pretty nicely considering the splattering of code I started with at first.Parse Function50:00 I walk through a quick install of an Apache Cassandra single node that I\u2019ll use for development use later. I also show quickly how to start and stop post-installation.Reference: Apache Cassandra, Download Page, and Installation Instructions.53:50 Choosing the go-twitter API library for Go. I look at a few real quickly just to insure that is the library I want to use.Reference: go-twitter library56:35 At this point I go through how I set a Twitter App within the API interface. This is a key part of the series where I take a look at the consumer keys and access token and access token secrets and where they\u2019re at in the Twitter interface and how one needs to reset them if they just showed the keys on a stream (like I just did, shockers!)57:55 Here I discuss and show where to setup the environment variables inside of Goland IDE to building and execution of the CLI. Once these are setup they\u2019ll be the main mechanism I use in the IDE to test the CLI as I go through building out further features.1:00:18 Updating the twitz config command to show the keys that we just added as environment variables. I set these up also with some string parsing and cutting off the end of the secrets so that the whole variable value isn\u2019t shown but just enough to confirm that it is indeed a set configuration or environment variable.1:16:53 At this point I work through some additional refactoring of functions to clean up some of the code mess that exists. Using Goland\u2019s extract method feature and other tooling I work through several refactoring efforts that clean up the code.1:23:17 Copying a build configuration in Goland. A handy little thing to know you can do when you have a bunch of build configuration options.1:37:32 At this part of the video I look at the app-auth example in the code library, but I gotta add the caveat, I run into problems using the exact example. But I work through it and get to the first error messages that anybody would get to pending they\u2019re using the same examples. I get them fixed however in the next session, this segment of the video however provides a basis for my pending PR\u2019s and related work I\u2019ll submit to the repo.The remainder of the video is trying to figure out what is or isn\u2019t exactly happening with the error.I\u2019ll include the working findem code in the next post on this series. Until then, watch the wrap up and enjoy!1:59:20 Wrap up of video and upcoming stream schedule on Twitch.UPDATED SERIES PARTSTwitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI for Parsing Text FilesTwitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI with Initial Twitter + Cassandra Installation (this post)Twitz Coding Session in Go \u2014 Cobra + Viper CLI Wrap Up + Twitter Data Retrieval", "responses": 0, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Thrashing Code", "Apache Cassandra", "Twitter Api"]}, {"title": "Santa Cruz Wins Thrilling Victory over RGV Vipers", "post_link": "https://2ways10days.com/santa-cruz-wins-thrilling-victory-over-rgv-vipers-83579791046d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Chris Reichert", "author_link": "https://2ways10days.com/@ChristopherReichert", "publish_date": "2016-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-28", "readtime": "2.30", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Santa Cruz Wins Thrilling Victory over RGV VipersChris ReichertFollowNov 19, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readSanta Cruz, CA \u2014 They might not have known the song playing during a \u2018Name That Tune\u2019 video segment at Kaiser Permanente Arena on Friday night, but the Warriors battled until the very end to pull off the 112\u2013110 victory over the visiting Rio Grande Valley Vipers. With the game tied with 24.5 seconds to go, Phil Pressey hit the go-ahead layup with one second remaining to seal the win for Santa Cruz.Fittingly enough, the song was Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 by Journey.Off the bench, Elgin Cook posted 23 points on 8\u20130f-14 from the field off the bench for the Warriors (2\u20131). It was a tightly contested game with 17 lead changes in all.\u201cWe got down early and we fought back,\u201d Cook said of the team\u2019s performance. \u201cI think we did a good job of forcing (the Vipers) to do things they\u2019re not accustomed to doing.\u201dSanta Cruz Warriors head coach Casey Hill knew Cook was capable of such a performance.\u201cHe and I sat together before the game and I told him that our first two games he\u2019s been decent, but he\u2019s got a whole other gear he can go to,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBoth on the defensive and offensive end.\u201dIsaiah Taylor notched a double-double for the Vipers (3\u20131) with 30 points on 8-of-17 from the field to go with 11 assists. He showed off his ability to attack the basket and find his way to the free throw line, with a perfect performance from the charity stripe (13-of-13).Kyle Wiltjer, on assignment from the Houston Rockets, led the team in scoring heading into Friday night with 27 points per contest. Santa Cruz held him to just nine points through the first 36 minutes.\u201c(Wiltjer) and amazing shooter,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo we had to crowd him and not give him much space. Every time he was in a ball screen we tried to switch it and just be physical with him.\u201dFellow assignee Chinanu Onuaku dropped 11 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Vipers in the defeat.With the game tied with less than a minute to go, Dennis Clifford hit the go-ahead runner with 33 seconds left to give the Warriors the lead.\u201c(Clifford) has been such a surprise for us,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s been great, I don\u2019t know what else to say about Dennis other than he\u2019s been nothing but a great teammate, he\u2019s executed everything we\u2019ve asked him to do, he\u2019s way tougher than everyone thought he was coming out of college and he\u2019s proving that he might end up being an NBA player.\u201dOn the ensuing possession, Taylor was fouled by Clifford and was sent to the free throw line. He would hit both free throws to tie the game and send Clifford to the bench after fouling out of the contest. Clifford finished with a double-double of his own with 14 points and 12 rebounds.The contest was marred with personal fouls, 15 between both teams in the first quarter and a combined 56 for the game with a player fouling out for each team.NBA legend Gary Payton was in attendance to watch his son, Gary Payton II play for the Vipers. Payton II scored eight points on 3-of-11, was 2-of-9 from three-point range and grabbed seven rebounds.Along with the game-winning shot, Pressey finished with 19 points on 8-of-17 from the floor and dished out nine assists as well in the victory, a win that shows the team\u2019s toughness according to Hill.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some stones.\u201d", "responses": 0, "tags": ["D League Digest"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@travelportal/vypeen-island-ernakulam-kochi-kerala-83178856450?source=search_post", "author_name": "Travel Tips", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@travelportal", "publish_date": "2016-11-26", "last_modified_date": "2016-11-26", "readtime": "1.00", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Travel TipsFollowNov 26, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readVypeen Island, Ernakulam / Kochi, KeralaVypin or Vypeen is one among a group of islands that are a part of Kochi in Kerala and is 5 km from Ernakulam town.

Le tableau de bord vous donne des statistiques sur le serveur, le temps que vous \u00eates connect\u00e9 au VPN et le type de protocole et de chiffrement que vous utilisez.Ce proxy Web compte 700 serveurs r\u00e9partis sur 52 sites diff\u00e9rents et il dispose \u00e9galement de 200 000 adresses IP. Avoir un grand nombre d\u2019adresses IP est important car cela signifie que ces adresses IP sont moins susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre signal\u00e9s comme suspects par les principaux moteurs de recherche, comme Google, ou des plateformes de m\u00e9dias sociaux, comme Facebook. Bien qu\u2019aucune entreprise ne peut garantir qu\u2019une adresse IP ne sera pas bloqu\u00e9e, le fait d\u2019avoir un nombre d\u2019adresses plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour effectuer le cycle r\u00e9duit le risque d\u2019\u00eatre bloqu\u00e9.Avec ce logiciel proxy, vous pouvez ex\u00e9cuter deux p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques simultan\u00e9ment sur un seul compte.

With their top rated VPN service, they provide Internet privacy, encryption, security services and so much more.Check the Latest DealsVyprVPN Secure Personal VPNGolden Frog was founded back in 1994, but only recently in 2010 VyprVPN introduced the company\u2019s premium VPN service for consumers. Just like other comparable VPN services, VyprVPN offers many features for all user needs.VyprVPN can be used to bypass website restrictions or filtering implemented by governments or work place filters. Using a VPN can allow users to surf the web securely and privately. All these Internet security features are available with the VyprVPN service for very low prices. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at what VyprVPN has to offer in our VyprVPN review.Installation & ConfigurationDuring our review of VyprVPN, we found the installation and configuration process is relatively smooth. Traditionally, VyprVPN is provided as a manually configurable service. Once you complete your account setup and payment, VyprVPN support sends you the setup parameters which include username, password and IP proxies as well as LAN settings.This information is used to set up VPN access through your device LAN settings. If you encounter any issues during setup there are numerous tutorials provided by Golden Frog to help you get the VPN connected successfully.VyprVPN\u2019s are always looking to make the service better, so they also provide an one-click application that streamlines the entire setup process of VPN re-routing. All you have to do is install the VyprVPN application, and the features is accessible via your notifications area in the task bar.You can change most of the settings and reroute your access through different countries, IPs, servers, security protocols and a many more features through the VyprVPN app. The application is clean and uncluttered, with only the features required accessible.The VyprVPN app is available for Windows and Mac OS X, iOS and Android devices and Linux. iPad\u2019s are supported via the iOS app.There are setup tutorials to help with installation and configuring the software, or you can contact Golden Frog customer care. VyprVPN supports a range of security protocols, varying from 1280-bit PPTP, 156-bit L2TP and 160 & 256 OpenVPN.VyprVPN has also introduced their own proprietary security protocol named Chameleon. This protocol is perfect for use in countries or network that have aggressive traffic filtering restrictions which use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).VyprVPN seem to be always introducing new features for their users. Among the latest additions is a SmartDNS feature called VyprDNS. SmartDNS has the same functionality as VPN in terms of circumventing geo-restricted content but is faster since it, unlike VPN, does not encrypt the data. VyprDNS is not sold as a standalone product, but offered as a feature for all VyprVPN users.Subscription CostThree subscription packages exist from VyprVPN, which depending on the users\u2019 VPN needs. These three packages are Basic, Pro or Premier VPN accesses.The cost of the Basic VyprVPN package is $9.99 per month. This comes with support for PPTP security protocol with 128-bit encryption. It also includes 10 GB of Dump Truck storage. The VPN package is also available on a yearly subscription basis which will further cut down the subscription fee to $6.67.The VyprVPN Pro package will cost you $14.99 per month for full access to all security protocols and supports two simultaneous connections along with 25 GB of free Dump Truck storage. To avail of the discounted rate, you can subscribe to a full-year term that would only cost $99.96.The Premier package, on the other hand, costs $19.99 per month and offers all of the features available in the Pro package, but you can enjoy more simultaneous connections (three devices in total) and a free 50 GB of Dump Truck storage.NAT Firewall option is now available free of cost for both Pro and Premier VyprVPN subscribers. NAT firewall is mainly targeted at wireless Internet users to prevent third party hackers from accessing sensitive information.VyprVPN has removed their old seven-day money back guarantee and are now offering a three-day free trial. This implies that you don\u2019t have to pay for the free trial, and if you wish to pay for the VPN service, you will be billed from the fourth day onward. Otherwise you can terminate the service within the three days and not have to pay any money.The payment option can hinder most secure web browsers. VyprVPN accepts credit card and PayPal payments, which should be sufficient for most buyers. Some users who are reluctant in provide personal information or credit card details to VPN networks may be missing a payment option that is completely anonymous, like Bitcoin.Check the Latest DealsSpeed, Reliability & BandwidthVyprVPN performs very well across all independent speed tests. Realistically, users can expect speeds ranging from 40\u201360 percent of the available browsing speed. At best, we were able to reach around 69 percent of the maximum available browsing speed, making VyprVPN an above average VPN service provider in the industry.You can stream videos and enjoy a few medium-sized downloads simultaneously. But if you are really working on an extremely fast network, you will find that VyprVPN has its speed capped to cater to the average customer demands. VyprVPN state that they offer unlimited speeds.We found VyprVPN very reliable during testing, with network drop outs only occurring occasionally. There were also a couple of times that I noticed a drop off in speed. This lead to longer website loading times, as well as timeout errors. In each case I rectified the issue by switching to a different server location.As you can see from the following VPN speed test on YouTube, VyprVPN really does perform well when it comes to upload and download speeds.VyprVPN allows unlimited usage and bandwidth, which is a significant selling point compared to other VPN services.Server LocationsVyprVPN has different servers spread around the globe. As of this writing, there are about 700+ servers operating in 40+ countries. Confidently, users can be assured of a secured VPN experience since GoldenFrog manages its own global network of servers, which by the way is now incorporated in Switzerland.One of the benefits of using VyprVPN is that it allows unlimited switches between servers. This is actually an advantage on VyprVPN\u2019s part, but there are no dedicated IPs. Dynamic IPs are offered to all their customers.Traditionally, VPN companies chose to install several different server farms in a specific country or server location. For instance, if a company has chosen the UK as a server location, there will be multiple servers and IPs that will be identifiable to the user as uk1, uk2, uk3, etc. as the prefix to the server address or URL. VyprVPN, on the other hand, chose to install a single server farm with multiple clusters.This ensures that the user will only have access to a single server address starting, like \u2018uk1\u2019, but behind that, you\u2019ll find multiple clusters that will reroute traffic according to the load or speed/bandwidth deficit. VyprVPN claims that this automatic server re-routing and switching will reduce downtime, which will in turn have positive effects on the user-experience. With this setup, VyprVPN offer more than 200,000 different IP addresses from its 43 server locations.At the time of writing this review these are just some of the international locations provided by VyprVPNEuropeAustria \u2014 ViennaBelgium \u2014 BrusselsCzech Republic \u2014 PragueDenmark \u2014 CopenhagenEurope \u2014 LuxembourgFinland \u2014 HelsinkiFrance \u2014 ParisGermany \u2014 FrankfurtIceland \u2014 Reykjav\u00edkIreland \u2014 DublinItaly \u2014 RomeLithuania \u2014 VilniusNetherlands \u2014 AmsterdamNorway \u2014 OsloPoland \u2014 WarsawPortugal \u2014 LisbonRomania \u2014 BucharestRussia \u2014 MoscowSpain \u2014 MadridSweden \u2014 StockholmSwitzerland \u2014 ZurichTurkey \u2014 IstanbulU.K. \u2014 LondonNorth AmericaCanada \u2014 TorontoMexico \u2014 Mexico CityU.S. \u2014 AustinU.S. \u2014 Los AngelesU.S. \u2014 MiamiU.S. \u2014 Washington, D.C.OceaniaAustralia \u2014 MelbourneAustralia \u2014 PerthAustralia \u2014 SydneyNew Zealand \u2014 AucklandSouth AmericaBrazil \u2014 S\u00e3o PauloAsiaAsia \u2014 Hong KongIndonesia \u2014 JakartaJapan \u2014 TokyoMalaysia \u2014 Kuala LampurPhilippines \u2014 ManilaSingapore \u2014 SingaporeSouth Korea \u2014 SeoulThailand \u2014 BangkokVietnam \u2014 HanoiCustomer SupportVyprVPN promises quality customer service, and all the correspondence is through email, live chat or ticket system. The live chat is available 24\u00d77 and you can avail of round the clock assistance from the helpful staff. Other VPN providers claim they have live chat support when in fact it\u2019s barely even online.Support ticket systems are notorious for their reputation of being backlogged. It might take a while to get through to support using the email or ticket system. The fastest option for reaching customer service should be the live chat feature. Once you reach a representative, you will find them to be helpful and attentive.Issues & ProblemsVyprVPN is not without fault. Website timeout and \u2018can\u2019t connect\u2019 error messages are not entirely absent, which can either be due to the computer, firewall or even server errors. In any case, server switching is the best line of action.The cost of subscription is slightly higher than some other providers. VyprVPN\u2019s overall service offering, however, is definitely above average, so if you can afford it, you get real quality with this premium provider.In terms of the Heartbleed and Shellshock bug vulnerabilities, the company affirm that their VPN service or any Golden Frog services for that matter are safe, for now. However, due to the nature of these bugs, the company still recommend that users change their password.Now if you have been experiencing some speed slowdowns when watching videos on Netflix, know that the problem is not from VyprVPN\u2019s network but rather, from Netflix itself. As a matter of fact, Golden Frog just released a second infographic in relation to why Netflix speeds have decreased over the past years. Do check out the infographic, \u201cThe Peering Problem\u201c.VyprVPN Review ConclusionIn conclusion to this VyprVPN review we\u2019ve found VyprVPN to be a top quality, no-nonsense VPN provider. They offer a high-performing service and don\u2019t promise anything they can\u2019t deliver. The cost of subscription may prevent some people from signing up to VyprVPN, but with the recent reduction in subscription cost (up to 33 percent) and the introduction of proprietary apps, we expect a huge growth in new customers.That being said, VyprVPN is excellent for those who expect safe and reliable web browsing with greater protection from security issues. If your budget allows for it, VyprVPN will give you the highest performance available on the market today. With the introduction of dedicated VyprVPN applications for Mac OS X and Windows, getting started is easy. The application can easily launch upon log in and run smoothly in the background.Discount & Coupon CodesAs with most other VPN service providers, VyprVPN offers a three-day free trial and no questions will be asked.Check the Latest DealsThe post VyprVPN Review \u2014 One of the Most Popular VPNs on the Market appeared first on VPN Comparisons 2016\u20132017.fromhttp://vpnreviews.online/vyprvpn-review/", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Magovi a Tokidovi vypr\u0161ela smlouva s MadCatz", "post_link": "https://czecharcade.com/magovi-a-tokidovi-vypr%C5%A1ela-smlouva-s-madcatz-9ef495dbefca?source=search_post", "author_name": "Czech Arcade", "author_link": "https://czecharcade.com/@CzechArcade", "publish_date": "2016-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2016-07-26", "readtime": "0.58", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Magovi a Tokidovi vypr\u0161ela smlouva s MadCatzCzech ArcadeFollowApr 13, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readKenryo \u201cMago\u201d Hayashi a Hajime \u201cTokido\u201d Taniguchi, oba p\u0159edn\u00ed hr\u00e1\u010di Street Fighteru, hr\u00e1li posledn\u00ed rok v t\u00fdmu MadCatz, je\u0161t\u011b spolu s Daigem \u201cThe Beast\u201d Umeharou.

Speziell am VPN-Angebot von Golden Frog ist, dass in dem VPN-Offerte gleichzeitig auch ein DNS-Service enthalten ist: VyprVPN. DNS-Server sind daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig, Hostnamen (wie z.B. VPN Vergleich) in eine f\u00fcr den Computer lesbare IP-Adresse zu \u00fcbersetzen.Die Firmen, die mit VyprVPN assoziiert sind, sind seit mehr als drei\u00dfig Jahren in der Entwicklung fortschrittlichster Verschl\u00fcsselungstechniken und damit zugeh\u00f6render Services t\u00e4tig. Demzufolge innovativ sind auch die Features von VyprVPN ausgefallen. Kunden von VyprVPN erhalten zus\u00e4tzlich einen inkludierten sicheren und anonyme DNS Server und ein selbstentwickeltes VPN Protokoll \u201eChameleon\u201c mit einer 256-Bit Verschl\u00fcsselung. Dies z\u00e4hlt zu den gegenw\u00e4rtigsten, flottesten und gesch\u00fctztesten Methoden bei der VPN-Daten\u00fcbertragung heute weltweit.Der VPN Client von VyprVPN ist sehr einfach und \u00fcbersichtlich gehalten. Neben dem gro\u00dfen Knopf im oberen Bereich der Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che kann man das Land w\u00e4hlen, aus dem man eine IP Adresse ben\u00f6tigt um z. b. Videostreaming anzusehen per Netflix. Im Vergleich zu anderen VPN Providern hat VyprVPN einen leicht verst\u00e4ndlichen, aufger\u00e4umten und professionellen VPN Client, der alles bietet was man im Normalfall braucht.Golden Frog betreibt \u00fcber 700 Server in 40 verschiedenen L\u00e4ndern, womit der Anbieter seinen Klienten mehr als 200.000 IP-Adressen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen kann. Features wie den regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Wechsel der IP Adresse bietet VyprVPN aber derzeit noch nicht.Golden Frog speichert generell keinerlei Informationen \u00fcber User-Aktivit\u00e4ten und den Traffic seiner Kunden auf seinen Servern \u2014 es sei denn, dies wird vom Kunden zu Support-Zwecken gew\u00fcnscht. Leider stehen bei VyprVPN keine anonymen Zahlungsmethoden zur Wahl \u2014 bezahlt werden kann lediglich via PayPal und mit Kreditkarte (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express).Die Bandbreite wird vom Anbieter nicht beschr\u00e4nkt. Die tats\u00e4chliche, vom Kunden erlebte Schnelligkeit h\u00e4ngt von diversen Bedingungen ab. Hierzu z\u00e4hlen beispielswiese die Bandbreite der eigenen Internetverbindung. Auch P2P und Filesharing ist auf den Servern des Anbieters gestattet. Laut Tests und Erfahrungen kann VyprVPN derzeit mit Windows, Mac, iOS und Android verwendet werden. Es darf zun\u00e4chst 3 Tage kostenlos getestet werden es gibt eine Geld-Zur\u00fcck-Garantie f\u00fcr 30 Tage.RELATED ARTIKEL : VyprVPN Erfahrungen", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vyprvpn Erfahrungen", "Vyprvpn Test", "Vyprvpn Kosten"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@carladjonesusa/golden-frog-vyprvpn-eb5be362b0c2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Carla Jones", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@carladjonesusa", "publish_date": "2017-05-13", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-13", "readtime": "1.24", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Carla JonesFollowMay 13, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readGolden Frog VyprVPN offers advanced features, a robust service, and a friendly interface, but you won\u2019t be able to cover as many devices as the competition.fromhttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ziffdavis/pcmag/~3/_-fMqUNy_9I/0,2817,2385182,00.asp", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "VyprVPN \u2014 A Fast Secure VPN Service Ready to Offer Fuller and Richer Online Experience", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vpnbeats/vyprvpn-a-fast-secure-vpn-service-ready-to-offer-fuller-and-richer-online-experience-e314bfba2ba5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vpn Beats", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vpnbeats", "publish_date": "2019-05-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-21", "readtime": "1.79", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "VyprVPN \u2014 A Fast Secure VPN Service Ready to Offer Fuller and Richer Online ExperienceVpn BeatsFollowMay 21 \u00b7 2 min readNeed to appreciate online protection, security and opportunity?

Speziell am VPN-Angebot von Golden Frog ist, dass in dem VPN-Offerte gleichzeitig auch ein DNS-Service enthalten ist: VyprDNS. DNS-Server sind daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig, Hostnamen (wie z.B. www.vpnvergleich.net) in eine f\u00fcr den Computer lesbare IP-Adresse zu \u00fcbersetzen.Die Firmen, die mit VyprVPN assoziiert sind, sind seit mehr als drei\u00dfig Jahren in der Entwicklung fortschrittlichster Verschl\u00fcsselungstechniken und damit zugeh\u00f6render Services t\u00e4tig. Demzufolge innovativ sind auch die Features von VyprVPN ausgefallen. Kunden von VyprVPN erhalten zus\u00e4tzlich einen inkludierten sicheren und anonyme DNS Server und ein selbstentwickeltes VPN Protokoll \u201eChameleon\u201c mit einer 256-Bit Verschl\u00fcsselung. Dies z\u00e4hlt zu den gegenw\u00e4rtigsten, flottesten und gesch\u00fctztesten Methoden bei der VPN-Daten\u00fcbertragung heute weltweit.Unsere Erfahrungen zeigen, dass der VPN Client von VyprVPN ist sehr einfach und \u00fcbersichtlich gehalten. Neben dem gro\u00dfen Knopf im oberen Bereich der Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che kann man das Land w\u00e4hlen, aus dem man eine IP Adresse ben\u00f6tigt um z. b. Videostreaming anzusehen per Netflix. Im Vergleich zu anderen VPN Providern hat VyprVPN einen leicht verst\u00e4ndlichen, aufger\u00e4umten und professionellen VPN Client, der alles bietet was man im Normalfall braucht.Golden Frog betreibt \u00fcber 700 Server in 40 verschiedenen L\u00e4ndern, womit der Anbieter seinen Klienten mehr als 200.000 IP-Adressen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen kann. Features wie den regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Wechsel der IP Adresse bietet VyprVPN aber derzeit noch nicht.Golden Frog speichert generell keinerlei Informationen \u00fcber User-Aktivit\u00e4ten und den Traffic seiner Kunden auf seinen Servern \u2014 es sei denn, dies wird vom Kunden zu Support-Zwecken gew\u00fcnscht. Erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df stehen leider bei VyprVPN keine anonymen Zahlungsmethoden zur Wahl \u2014 bezahlt werden kann lediglich via PayPal und mit Kreditkarte (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express).Die Bandbreite wird vom Anbieter nicht beschr\u00e4nkt. Die tats\u00e4chliche, vom Kunden erlebte Schnelligkeit h\u00e4ngt von diversen Bedingungen ab. Hierzu z\u00e4hlen beispielswiese die Bandbreite der eigenen Internetverbindung. Auch P2P und Filesharing ist auf den Servern des Anbieters gestattet. Laut Tests und Erfahrungen kann VyprVPN derzeit mit Windows, Mac, iOS und Android verwendet werden. Es darf zun\u00e4chst 3 Tage kostenlos getestet werden es gibt eine Geld-Zur\u00fcck-Garantie f\u00fcr 30 Tage.RELATED ARTIKEL : VyprVPN Erfahrungen", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vyprvpn Kosten", "Vyprvpn Erfahrungen", "Vyprvpn Test"]}, {"title": "Make a great downloader CLI by Cobra + Viper + PromptUI at Golang", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ducmeit/make-a-great-downloader-cli-by-cobra-viper-promptui-at-golang-f6408434cafa?source=search_post", "author_name": "Duc Ho", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ducmeit", "publish_date": "2019-07-18", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-20", "readtime": "3.45", "claps": 7, "voters": 7, "content": "Make a great downloader CLI by Cobra + Viper + PromptUI at GolangDuc HoFollowJul 18 \u00b7 4 min readPhoto by Marvin Meyer on UnsplashIn this article, I would like to show you how to make a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) at Golang with Cobra, Viper, and PromptUI. We are going to make a simple downloader for song and video with multiple quality on the ZING MP3 website (a music/video stream online). I hope after you read this article, you will have the confidence to build your own CLI by yourself for multiple purposes.PrerequisitesI used Go version 1.12 with Go Module for manage dependency packages.You should look at a bit about Cobra, Viper, PromptUI if it has unfamiliar with you.OverviewsIn this article, I will combine multiple packages as the title name above of the article consists: Cobra, Viper, PromptUI. So, who are they?Cobra: A popular and simple library to build a modern commander at Golang.Viper: A library helps to write and read the configuration from differents support file extension such as TOML, JSON, YAML,\u2026PromptUI: A library helps to make the CLI more interactives by support prompt data.Show me the source codesducmeit1/zmp3zmp3 is a CLI tool helps you download the highest quality of music and video on https://mp3.zing.vn for free \u2026github.comYou can download this application here with version 1.0Build your first CLI with CobraYour application will be run and control by the core of Cobra. The first requirement you must define the Root Command and execute it in main() function at the main package of the project. For example:cmd/root.gomain.goThe main function is quite simple, all you need to do let\u2019s root command execute itself by Execute() function.Next, we are going to implement child commands for the root command consists: Download Song and Download Video.It\u2019s pretty easy to understand. We just have to create new two commands and use init() function to add both of them into the root command. After added successfully, we can use them by calling: zmp3 song / zmp3 videoWrite and Read the configuration with ViperFor storing the configuration to understand which quality of MP3 and MP4 that you want to download and where is the download folder as well, we could use Viper to helps you storing and reading to the configuration. The configuration will be stored by a TOML file, default name of this file is \u201czingmp3_downloader.toml\u201d.Use Prompt to make your application more interactivesWe can use PromptUI to make your application more interactive by using it to enter a new configuration consists:Set the new quality of MP3/MP4 (Prompt Integer)Set the new download folder name (Prompt String)Go back to root.go, we will add a Flag to make an optional to help the client set a new configuration.Set a flag with boolean typevar setConfig boolSet the default value and command for the user to change the value of this flag in init() functionImplement code:And in the RunE function, let\u2019s implement like this:It\u2019s pretty simple, if setConfig variable is set by true, than return to setNewConfig() function by call zmp3 -cAll rights, now you already have known how to combine Cobra, Viper, PromptUI for making a great CLI.

Later on, a more detailed article was released in one of the objc.io Issues.The detailed article explains the motivations for using VIPER:TestabilityFixing the Massive View Controller issuesApplication Design based on Use CasesFitting well with Platform Frameworks (like UIKit)Building features as Independent ModulesSo can we consider VIPER a Software Architecture or just a Design Pattern?The VIPER diagram defines a structure which seems like an architecture but may create a limited outlook of the application. Even though VIPER is presented as an architecture to solve the \u201cMVC\u201d limitations (where components can only be seen as Models, Views or Controllers), VIPER may have the same limitations (where components can only be seen as Views, Interactors, Presenters, Entities, or Routers).In reality, the authors say that VIPER is \u201cmainly\u201d divided into those types, but can have less or even more layers of separation, as needed. Unfortunately, many developers end up trying to follow the \u201cacronym template\u201d (like it happens with the MVC design pattern).VIPER can solve the Massive View Controller problem and make your code more Testable, but it doesn\u2019t solve the \u201cSoftware Architecture\u201d problem. By following the VIPER template, we may end up with Clean Code, but Spaghetti Architecture!For example, let\u2019s have a look at the Todo List sample project dependencies diagram.Todo List sample project class and module dependencies diagram.As you can see, there are arrows pointing everywhere. Even crossing module boundaries. Dependencies look out of control, so changes to the software can break multiple modules (and of course, multiple tests).VIPER was introduced as an iOS implementation of Uncle Bob\u2019s Clean Architecture. If we compare the two, they have similarities, especially in their layers names. However, a closer look shows that, at least by analyzing the VIPER Todo List example, they don\u2019t share the same structure and goals. In Uncle Bob\u2019s Clean Architecture, the Frameworks and Drivers (e.g. UIKit and CoreData) are just \u201cdetails\u201d or \u201cplugins\u201d to the Business Logic Layer. Instead, in common VIPER implementations, the frameworks end up at the center of the application. (There are also crucial data flow differences that Paul Stringer explains in this article.)VIPER Todo sample project \u201cOnion Layers\u201d diagram separate by features and dependencies with the frameworks at the centerWe believe that software architecture is less about your responsibilities and more about how the components communicate with each other and how they depend on each other. What is coupled and why? What is decoupled and why? What is hard to change and why? What is easy to change and why? How is the data flowing between layers \u2014 is the data going in one direction? two directions? multiple directions? Can we support short and long-term business goals?Regardless if we\u2019re following or not some sort of named architecture like VIPER, our software is structured in many components that can be coupled or decoupled. This software structure or the components structure is our architecture.Our codebases are like living organisms, and they\u2019re changing all the time. So does the architecture. It\u2019s constantly changing. And It can move in a positive or negative direction.Modularity, for example, is a good architecture trait, but not all architectures are modular. If we don\u2019t have modularity in our systems, it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have an architecture. However, we might quickly find out that the lack of modularity prevents us from moving fast and prevents us from achieving key business metrics. For example:Deployment FrequencyEstimation AccuracyLead Time for ChangesMean Time to RecoverAt Essential Developer, our main drives are Empathy, Integrity, and Economics. Business metrics are part of Economics. When we make decisions such as the system architecture, we must care about Economics. And we do believe that Software Architecture has a strong correlation with Product Success. Product Longevity. Product Sustainability.In our experience, MVC, MVP, MVVM, and VIPER are good design patterns when used with care. However, they are not enough to define the \u201cSoftware Architecture\u201d of our systems.For more, visit the Clean iOS Architecture Playlist.Subscribe now to our Youtube channel and catch free new episodes every week.Originally published at www.essentialdeveloper.com.Let\u2019s connectIf you enjoyed this article, visit us at https://essentialdeveloper.com and get more in-depth tailored content like this.Follow us on: YouTube \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Facebook \u2022 GitHub", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "iOS App Development", "Software Architecture", "Design Patterns", "Viper"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@cmeeren/vyprvpn-vs-private-internet-access-my-conversation-with-them-and-why-ill-stick-to-pia-for-now-9d8e216dcb47?source=search_post", "author_name": "Christer van der Meeren", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@cmeeren", "publish_date": "2014-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-12", "readtime": "10.4", "claps": 101, "voters": 6, "content": "Christer van der MeerenFollowNov 10, 2014 \u00b7 11 min read(Note to the faint-hearted: There is a lot of text here due to the email correspondence, which is included for completeness and transparency, but you can safely skip the quotes and still get the general gist.)Which VPN provider should you choose? There is a host of options available, and two solid ones seem to be Private Internet Access (PIA) and VyprVPN. PIA claims they absolutely do not keep any logs at all \u2013 you\u2019ll just have to believe them. VyprVPN do log some information for 30 days, and claims that a no-logging policy makes it difficult to provide a reliable service, and that what the users should be aiming for is full transparency from their VPN provider.The way I see it, at the end of the day, it comes down to trust. Do you trust that PIA never logs anything? Do you trust that VyprVPN keeps to their logging policy?I recently came across a deal on VyprVPN. I proceeded to read quite a bit about them on their website (which is highly informative and well laid out), and considered switching to them from PIA. The fly in the ointment: They do keep logs, and I am currently using a service which claims to not keep any logs at all. I contacted the two companies and we sent some emails back and forth, and below is the email correspondence.The bottom line: While VyprVPN is very transparent on their website, they seemed somewhat evasive in their answers. PIA was more open and forthright in addressing my questions.Let me just say first that I am in no way affiliated with VyprVPN or PIA. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get started:Contacting VyprVPNIn my initial email to VyprVPN, I questioned why VyprVPN was keeping logs for 30 days, containing source IP, VyprVPN IP, and timestamp. Wouldn\u2019t this enable people with access to the logs to trace my activity?Hi! I heard about you through your deal with SpiderOak.In your privacy policy, you say the following:\u201cEach time a user connects to VyprVPN, we retain the following data for 30 days: the user\u2019s source IP address, the VyprVPN IP address used by the user, connection start and stop time and total number of bytes used.\u201dIsn\u2019t that rather serious? Doesn\u2019t that mean that anyone with access to the logs (governments with subpoenas, hackers, or you yourselves) can identify me and link me and my \u201cprivate\u201d IP to my traffic usage at the other end of the VPN? If I do something that a government is not very fond of, and they log my external IP and get access to your logs within 30 days, doesn\u2019t that mean that I am implicated? If this is the case, forgive me the harsh statement, it hardly seems worth using your VPN service, especially since there are VPN services that do not log anything at all. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I am currently using Private Internet Access VPN. I am not completely happy with the service (AFAIK they don\u2019t have their own DNS [they do in fact have their own no-logging DNS, but I didn\u2019t know at the time] \u2013 they have DNS leak protection, but that causes connectivity problems for me), but they do not keep any logs at all and allow completely anonymous payment options (gift cards, etc.). That way I am guaranteed that my activity and external IP in no way can be linked to me.In their reply they copy-pasted from their VPN myths page the entirety of Myth #7 (about why some logging is good) and Myth 4 (warning against \u201cno-log\u201d services, saying you are not anonymous anyway and questioning the validity and technical feasability of the no-log policy), ending on a courteous \u201cI hope this has cleared up some issues for you. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to let us know.\u201dI did not hesitate to let them know. I reworded my main point and asked quite clearly whether you could be traced by anyone with access to the logs \u2013 I wanted a clear answer to this.Thank you, it clears up but not all of it. My main question still remains. Let\u2019s say I do something which some government or authority does not approve of. Could be anything \u2013 criticizing dictators, pirating a movie, planning world dominion. They log the IP that they can see, which is my VyprVPN IP. Is it then true that they can potentially get access to the logs (e.g. subpoena, hacking), connect my VyprVPN IP to my source IP, and trace the source IP back to me and identify me?They got back to me saying that they will not hand out data unless \u201cdirected to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter\u201d, which is definitely not a \u201cno\u201d:We apologize for the confusion. Golden Frog will not sell or otherwise release a member\u2019s identifying information \u2014 minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more \u2014 or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information.Golden Frog cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before Golden Frog provides a member\u2019s identifying information \u2014 minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more. In a criminal investigation Golden Frog is required by the Law to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the member.You can find out more on our private policy which can be found on the link below.http://www.goldenfrog.com/privacyIf you have further questions please reply to this email! Thanks again.Really trying to get a clear answer from VyprVPNThey seemed really reluctant to say \u201cyes, you can be tracked by anyone with access to logs\u201d, but at the same time they definitely did not say it was impossible. Although I felt fairly sure it was possible by now, I was determined to try to get an answer to the question one more time. I phrased it as a statement and an example to check my understanding, and also inquired as to why exactly they log both the source and external IP:Again, thank you for the good answer. I want to put out two statements check my understanding. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Finally, I will put forth a question regarding this topic. In your reply, I would appreciate if you could address each of these statements/questions in a concrete manner.Statement 1: Based on the first reply I got from you (citing your website), I understand why some kind of logging has to take place to deliver a reliable service. But I don\u2019t understand why you have to log, specifically, both the source IP and external (VyprVPN) IP. It seems to me that if you do not log any single one of these two IPs, there is no possibility of identifying the user through you, and thus the user can feel much safer. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong here.Statement 2 (example): A user lives in a country with severe internet censorship and with effectively a government ban on freedom of speech. Consider a user in that country operating through your service, criticizing the government. The government of course deems this unlawful and logs the external (VyprVPN) IP of the user. If I understand correctly, the government can then (within 30 days) subpoena for your logs, connect their logged (VyprVPN) IP to the user\u2019s source IP, identify the user, and take any kind of abominable action against the user. In this case, the user was implicated even though they used VyprVPN to spread important critical information on the government. Again, if you (VyprVPN) did not log either one of the two IPs, the government, even with access to the logs, would have no way of tracing the external (VyprVPN) IP back to the user. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong here.Specific question: Why, exactly, do you have to log both the source IP and external (VyprVPN) IP? Could you go into details as to what, specifically, this permits you to do that would otherwise be impossible?It came as no surprise that the answer was not very detailed and ended on \u201cwe\u2019re not able to address your hypothetical situations directly\u201d:Thank you for your reply! We\u2019ll be happy to address your concerns. We log both the source IP and external IP in order to ensure that our service is not used for abusive purposes. Abusive purposes includes anything prohibited by our terms of service. You can view that here:http://www.goldenfrog.com/terms-of-serviceIn short, we log IPs to maintain order on our network and ensure quality service for our users.It sounds like you\u2019re asking about a service that makes you anonymous. You are not anonymous when you are online, even when using privacy tools like Tor, Bitcoin, or a VPN. Every service has at least one piece of information that can be used to distinguish different users, whether it\u2019s a set of IP addresses (VPN and Tor) or a wallet (Bitcoin). This information alone may not reveal any private details about the user, but it can be associated with other similar information to eventually identify an individual.I hope this clears up the situation a little. While we\u2019re not able address your hypothetical situations directly, we try to explain our policies in the context of our belief in a free and open Internet for users in all countries as well as our respect for the rule of law.I now gave up on ever trying to get a clear answer to the traceability while using VyprVPN. I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s fully possible.Contacting Private Internet AccessI did however send an email to PIA, bringing forth the questions from VyprVPN\u2019s Myth 4 (where they rhetorically question how VPN providers are able to operate without logging). I didn\u2019t get a copy of my initial questions (submitted through a form on their website), but their response (woven into my questions) were:Thanks for contacting us. I have addressed each of your questions below:1. If you have some limit to the number of connections per user, how is this possible without logging?***The connections are limited by the number of active log in sessions. The time the login was authenticated, the length of the connection, and other such details are never recorded. The server has to be able to see that you are logged in in order to provide the connection, but the details of your log in are never saved anywhere.***2. How can you troubleshoot my connection or offer support for server side problems without logging?***Debugging information is different from the logs that could be used to track user activities. It is possible to compile a debugging report without compromising the security and privacy of our users. Also, a log of possible connection issues is stored locally on your computer, and can be sent to us by you if you so choose. The information compiled there is specifically related to errors that might appear when OpenVPN tries to connect. The information about your computer is extremely limited, and possible to exclude if you so choose.***3. How can you handle my DNS requests when using the VPN service without logging? Do you rely on a 3rd Party DNS provider that may log DNS requests?***The VPN assigns our DNS servers to your computer, so all DNS requests are automatically routed through our servers. The DNS servers that we use do not log, and are not hosted by a third party.***4. How do you prevent abuse, such as spammers, port scanners, and DDOS to protect your VPN service and your users without logging?***When these activities are reported to us, we have proprietary methods available to deal with these issues without compromising the security and privacy of other users. I apologize, but I am not able to share more details regarding this, as these methods are part of the reason that we are able to offer a truly log free service that is not inundated with spammers and the like, and revealing them would cost us our competitive edge.***5. Is it at all possible to trace me by IP when using the service? Am I anonymous as far as my IP go? For example, other VPN providers might log my external IP, source IP and timestamp for some amount of time, which would allow my activity to be traced back to me by people with access to the logs (e.g. governments with subpoenas, hackers, etc.)***No, it is in no way possible to track your IP address through the VPN. When you connect to the VPN, all internet traffic is routed through the VPN IP address. Hackers, trackers, and anyone else will see the VPN IP address when trying to track you, and they will not be able to track you past the VPN\u2019s IP address.***6. In your Terms of Service, you write: \u201cFailure to comply with the present Terms of Service \u2026 may result in one or more of these following actions: \u201c whereafter you write, among other things,\u201cLegal actions against you for reimbursement of any costs incurred via indemnity resulting from a breach\u201dand\u201cDisclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as deemed reasonably necessary\u201d.6a) How are these actions possible unless you log?***As mentioned previously, we do have proprietary methods for dealing with situations involving ToS violations.***6b) Is this just legal boilerplate without any practical effect since you (presumably) do not log anything, and therefore are unable to perform any of these actions?***I can assure you that our Terms of Service will be enforced if necessary. However, actual instances of having to do this are extremely rare.***6c) Are you really unable to perform any of these actions?***We can and if necessary will perform all actions in our Terms of Service to ensure that the VPN remains viable for all users. However, as I mentioned above, the actual need for enforcing the ToS is extremely rare.***I hope you find my answers satisfactory, and would be happy to provide further information if necessary.In a follow-up email I wondered whether PIA had any way of listening in on the traffic. My question was elevated to Tier 2 tech support, who could assure me that \u201cWe have no ability to see what you are doing on the VPN. The traffic is heavily encrypted, and even our server admins cannot see the traffic that is passing.\u201dAnyway, I brought the answers from PIA back to VyprVPN, and they only repliedThank you for your reply. The answers from our competitor appear to boil down to:\u201cThat\u2019s proprietary information, and I can\u2019t tell what we\u2019re doing with your data.\u201dGolden Frog is open about what we do with your data and why. If you have any more questions about our service or why we log, please let us know.Which, competitors or not, is a fair point. I cannot see any way of dealing with ToS violations judicially without evidence in the form of logs. While I don\u2019t have any special knowledge of judicial processes, this fact could easily make my trust in PIA falter.However, I recently came across a subpoena request to PIA and PIA\u2019s response, where they make it absolutely clear, under penalty of law, that they did not have logs that far back (2 months). While this is no guarantee for not keeping any logs at all, it is enough for me to keep my trust in PIA\u2019s no-log policy.Final ThoughtsChoosing a VPN provider, or anything related to security, is a matter of trust. I appreciate the fact that PIA has proprietary methods to make their no-log policy work. It does not really seem any worse than VyprVPN being open about keeping logs. Even though they claim transparency above all, you still have to trust the information just the same as you have to trust PIA in their no-logging policy. Besides, some of the information on the VyprVPN website concerning no-logging VPN providers seem to me like little else than rank fearmongering \u2013 keeping PIA\u2019s answers in mind, VyprVPN don\u2019t really provide good arguments for why logging is a technical necessity.In the end, I am sticking with PIA.

We\u2019ve been very pragmatic in how we\u2019ve used the business logic, service layer and the views, yet we didn\u2019t sacrifice the quality and provided high test coverage. Keep in mind that we are talking here only about Dashboard module coverage, of course\u2026 There\u2019s quite a lot of boilerplate elsewhere which is not tested.Boilerplate codeWe can see, that thanks to Module Oriented Architecture and use of protocol extensions, we have reduced the boilerplate to the total minimum:Wireframes are reduced to a minimum of instantiating variablesPresenters implement 3 mini functions of ModuleRoutable protocolModule classes also contain measely 4 variables\u2026Almost no boilerplate code of whatsoever\u2026 Also, not a lot of code to add at all, to make the core VIPER classes functioning, which greatly reduces the time and also learning curve. This makes ideal base also for prototypes and small projects, gives almost a commodity of kind of framework that does the job for you.Seamless integration of Apple\u2019s MVC and StoryboardsFor those who have read already the Module Oriented Architecture series, but especially the Part 6 \u2014 Outsmarting the MVC, you already understand, how complexity of integrating your business flow with UI Navigation elements was made smooth and without them taking over our architecture and application flow.Complex communication between the classesI think we\u2019ve dealt with that one too in a clean and safe way from memory management perspective, again, benefiting from Module Oriented Architecture, VIPER and fundamental OOP principles. To substantiate this, I will use the class schema from Part 1 again:View Controller communicates with the Presenter unilaterally and also owns itPresenters do the same with WireframesWireframes create View Controllers and assign them to application\u2019s View/Navigation stackModel objects are never persisted or made stateful in any other wayPresenter is the only one that owns View ModelsView objects don\u2019 t reference any other object in a classModule doesn\u2019t own any class, it acts merely as an gateway to create Presenter and as soon as the latter creates View Controller through Wireframe, is gets assigned to it and it\u2019s gone from the Model\u2019s function scope/loop and there is no connection to it from the outsideAs soon as the structure is formed, we can see, that there is only one owner of the whole graph, which is basically UIWindow and as soon as user, for example, taps \u2018back\u2019 button, View Controller is deallocated and with it the whole structure. No way, we can incurr and large scale memory leaksWhat could go wrong?Few things. One would argue that Presenter ideally shouldn\u2019t have the state. Although I think that would be a bit too assertive, I agree if this wouldn\u2019t be Dashboard, but some service module, we would have to synchronize the access to the properties at least. Still, making it stateless would either create one additional API call for populating thePaymentDetailViewController or creating the latter in one go and retain it somewhere else, which would be a very dirty solution\u2026Also, what would be more general, if the view would be more complex, we would get much more relations between the objects and Presenter could become a busy junction with too many tasks and too much coupled.But that is something, what we shall tackle in the next part, where things will get a bit more complicated\u2026ConclusionOur demo project in its first stage delivers well against the expectations set in the Part 1 and we need to see, whether it will withstand the test of complexity.

Presenters handle the call either by creating new View Controllers or calling Interactors or anything else for that matter.But what if the path from the View to Presenter is not that simple and short?Cell got a CTA ButtonRequest for Refund CTACTA Button? So what? Connect it to LastPaymentsViewControlleras you did with the other outlets and you have direct path to DashboardPresenter. Again.Yes. Could work. But what if our cell is not a Prototype Cell in Interface Builder anymore? What if it resides in its own .xibfile? Well, this is where it starts to get interesting. Namely, the owner of the .xibfile is DashboardPaymentCelland that one gets instantiated by the Interface Builder at the runtime, added to Table View and doesn\u2019t reference any other object in our graph.How to propagate our event and its parameters back to the business logic? We can do it in many ways, let\u2019s mention some:going hacky way and figure out from the DashboardPaymentCell which Table View owns it and then go from there. Nasty way\u2026we could pass an action delegate to the cell when we populate it and then handle it there, it could be our DashboardPresenter.we could pass our DashboardPresenter directly to the DashboardPaymentCell\u2026Plenty of possibilities, but none fits perfectly or at least attractive enough.If we pass Presenter in any form, then this would actually serve the purpose now. But what if we have a lot of such events, which we usually do? What if each of these events needs different handling? Well, in that case, our Presenter could get very cluttered, loaded with extensions conforming to protocols, each representing on specific event handling, being referenced by all too many objects, especially views, becoming Godfather to them all\u2026In many cases, we would create a separate event handling objects and our Presenter would suddenly lose its god name of being an object which responsibility is to handle presentation logic and not being some sort of event handling proxy. Although, the idea of such object is not bad at all\u2026 Imagine the object, something like Event Proxy, very lightweight, which would connect event creators with event handlers\u2026Now, that looks similar to many concepts in many languages and SDKs. Like EventEmitters in Javascript, for example. Why wouldn\u2019t we take the concept here and make it work in Swift as well? Surely it doesn\u2019t feel like something extraordinary and platform specific?It\u2019s not. Let\u2019s make something like this:So, what we have is:EventEmitter object which stores array of callback closuresSubscribers(Handlers) subscribe to EventEmitter with a closureEmitter objects fire an event with the payload of simple dictionary which is then delivered anonymously through the closure to SubscribersEvents can be plenty!Now, imagine that we add all kinds of analytics to our app. Sending events with the payloads to our data analytics endpoints. EventEmitters seem like an ideal tool for it.Actually, we can put all kinds of events into the same payload corresponding to one user action and different subscribers simply take their own relevant information filtered by the key, if it exists. So, instead of calling multiple closures or multiple delegates from the object which received user action, we simply fire one payload to one EventEmitters and whoever is interest in particular part of the payload will handle it!.Sounds almost like perfect! Hm\u2026 sounds very familiar, sounds almost like\u2026..Notification??(NS)NotificationCenterBut, but, but,\u2026 why not just (NS)NotificationCenter then?Indeed, why not? It\u2019s a clear example of Publish-Subscribe patterns and there is no coupling between the publisher and subscriber. NotificationCenter is a global, which deliver a simple payload and that\u2019t more or less it.Well, I have to admit I was never a big fan of the approach. I remember once having to refactor one Mac OS app. It contained over 70 different notifications and you can imagine how hard it was for me to debug such an app, poised with race conditions amongst others.That was also the time I realised NSNotifications are not always thread safe and this hadn\u2019t really been resolved up until iOS 9.But there are many more issues that have always bothered meGlobal character of NSNotificationCenter makes it all too easy to subscribe wrong object to the wrong notification, which could easily cause crashes or other problems when object, subscribed to wrong notification got unexpected payload and it couldn\u2019t be parsed as expected. Of course this smells also of unsafe coding, but the latter can be a fact all too many timesInspecting the stack on debugger between Subscriber and Publisher doesn\u2019t tells us much, there\u2019s no direct link between the threadsNot easy to test, because NSNotificationCenter is a global broker for event messages, making itself a middleman and to have it tested and since it\u2019s a singleton, we can\u2019t speak about unit test isolation case anymore. Mocking it would require code to change just to accommodate the mock, which is not a good pattern.Requires unsubscribing, otherwise you end up with memory leaksHow does then our own EventEmitter compares to this:It has a local, module character, all its scope is contained within the moduleVery easy to debug, you just simply put a single breakpoint on publishing function and this is it. We shall see that later in the codeOne place for all events, structurally within the enum, but we can split them into multiple EventEmitter classes, if we would like to. It would break up a single, overall view, but it still gives us a much better overview than leaving single publishing instantiations around our code, like in case of NSNotificationCenter.Payloads are simple collections, dictionaries within the closure, always passed by value, no race conditions possiblePayload delivery, the emitting part in EventEmitter is synchronised and its \u201ccomplexity\u201d contained within EventEmitter's protocol extensionWith main View Controller dismissed, all other objects, including EventEmitter are de-allocated, no fear of any memory leaks, the only thing we have to be careful about is weakly referencing EventEmitter in all other objects but Presenter who owns it in our case.No need for any \u201cunsubscribing\u201d, because if the objects, who pass subscribing closure to the EventEmitter, will with the help of compiler capture their [weak self]thus making this crash safeShort summaryIf I look at the summary, I have no doubts about the winner\u2026What next?The next step is of course the demo project code, which will be described in the next, last part.Stay tuned!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "Swift", "Viper", "Events", "Software Architecture"]}, {"title": "UX Camp Europe: Ako to vyzer\u00e1, ke\u010f sa stretne 500 najlep\u0161\u00edch UX dizajn\u00e9rov!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/popcorn-digit%C3%A1lna-porcia-online-noviniek/ux-camp-europe-ako-to-vyzer%C3%A1-ke%C4%8F-sa-stretne-500-najlep%C5%A1%C3%ADch-ux-dizajn%C3%A9rov-8989176e6149?source=search_post", "author_name": "CORE4", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CORE4", "publish_date": "2016-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-25", "readtime": "4.98", "claps": 5, "voters": 5, "content": "UX Camp Europe: Ako to vyzer\u00e1, ke\u010f sa stretne 500 najlep\u0161\u00edch UX dizajn\u00e9rov!CORE4FollowAug 5, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readPripravte sa, toto bude dlh\u0161\u00ed \u010dl\u00e1nok.

The types of architectural patterns may vary, but there are 4 most commonly-used ones - the ones whole IT world continuously criticizes but keeps using at the same time: MVC, MVP, MVVM and Viper (the last one as iOS architecture pattern mostly). The comparison of these patterns and choosing a better fit for each Swift-written project\u2019s case will be discovered further on in this article.Following the chronological order of things, once the first software design patterns have appeared, the common issues of those ios development architecture patterns didn\u2019t take long to arrive. For instance, the problem of server-client communication - how does one interact with another? Or a different one - the problem of separating the application\u2019s business logic from the in-app\u2019s logic; how this one should perform in terms of application\u2019s architecture? Due to them various design patterns for different architecture layers have seen the world; the most well-known amongst them are:Please continue reading on our blog MVP vs MVC vs MVVM vs VIPER.

VIPER are all classes having dedicated role and responsibility.VIPER mainly focused on IOS app but you can use this for Android applications too. It is also known as Clean architecture.Why to use VIPERThere are many good architectures available like MVP, MVVM, MVC. Each with their own Marits and demerits, such as Presenter in MVP becomes too huge to manage, Similarly with MVVM communication between various MVVM components and data binding can be painful which may not be suitable or desirable in your project.So, if you are looking for something who sets clear responsibilities, wants to keep your source code cleaner, more compact, and reusable with number of more features then here you can go further and understand VIPER.VIPER IntroductionVIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. This architecture is based on the Single Responsibility Principle which leads to a clean architecture and a better structure for your iOS & Android project.Let\u2019s look at what each letter means more in details:View: The responsibility of the view is to send the user actions to the presenter and show whatever the presenter tells it.Interactor: This is the backbone of an application as it contains the business logic described by the use cases in the application. The interactor is responsible for fetching data from the model layer, and its implementation is totally independent of the user interface.Presenter: Its responsibility is to get the data from the interactor on user actions, create a view model instance, and carry it to the View to show it.Entity: It contains basic model objects used by the Interactor. It has part of the responsibilities of the model layer in the other architectures.Router: It has all navigation logic for describing which screens are to be shown when.In Viper architecture, each block corresponds to an object with specific tasks, inputs, and outputs. It is very similar to workers in an assembly line: once the worker completes its job on an object, the object is passed along to the next worker, until the product is finished. The connections between the blocks represent the relationship between the objects, and what kind of information they transmit to each other. The communication from one entity to another is given through protocols.The idea behind this architecture pattern is to isolate your app\u2019s dependencies, balancing the delegation of responsibilities among the entities. Basically, Viper architecture divides your application logic into smaller layers of functionality, each of them with a strict, predefined responsibility. This makes it easier to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers. It fits very well with unit testing, and makes your code more reusable.Getting Started for AndroidNow as our main focus to use VIPER architecture for android Apps so our architecture name will be now VIP + R because to develop Android app will be required only View for your user interface, Interactor for business login, Presenter as intermediator between View and Interactor as we are passing the data from interactor to View and Router will be required for navigate from one screen to another screen.Note \u2014 Instead of creating VIP structure manually I will recommend you to refer VIP Template to generate VIP Structure.Let\u2019s start to create SampleViper App in Android Studio.SampleAppRight click on a package that you want to create the module and select it from New -> Other -> VIPER TemplateVIP TemplateType a Viper Module name (HomeScreen) -> FinishHomeScreen VIP StructureYou can see the VIP Template for HomeScreen is auto generated. So now Make your HomeScreenActivity as launcher activity and remove MainActivity if not required.Let\u2019s discuss about all classes one by one and will check the role and responsibility of each class.1.HomeScreenActivityHomeScreenActivity is our Main Activity for HomeScreen it will extend the HomeScreenView interface which is defined in HomeScreenPresenter.Its task is call the business login which is written in Interactor and update the User Interface when presenter returns the data via View Interface.package viper.test.sampleapp;import android.os.Bundleimport android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivityclass HomeScreenActivity : AppCompatActivity(), HomeScreenView {    lateinit var interactor: HomeScreenInteractor    lateinit var router: HomeScreenRouter    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)        setContentView(R.layout.main.xml)        HomeScreenConfigurator.configure(this)        interactor.getSomething(\"param1\", \"param2\")    }    override fun displaySomething() {        //display something        print(\"displaySomething\")    }}2. HomeScreenConfigurator \u2014 It\u2019s our singleton class and we will be required this to initialise all other classes. And will call this from the HomeScreenActivity.package viper.test.sampleapp;class HomeScreenConfigurator {companion object Singleton {fun configure(activity: HomeScreenActivity) {val router = HomeScreenRouter()router.activity = activityval presenter = HomeScreenPresenter()presenter.activity = activityval interactor = HomeScreenInteractor()interactor.presenter = presenteractivity.interactor = interactoractivity.router = router}}}3. HomeScreenInteractor \u2014 This is the class where all the business login of HomeScreen will be written. After business logic whatever result will be coming that Interactor has to send to presenter to display in View.package viper.test.sampleapp;class HomeScreenInteractor {lateinit var presenter: HomeScreenPresenterfun getSomething(aParam1: String, aParam2: String) {//Show loadingval request = HomeScreenViewModel.Request(aParam1, aParam2)//Initiate Worker if need using 'request'showSomething()}private fun showSomething() {presenter.presentSomething()//Hide loading}}4. HomeScreenPresenter \u2014 Presenter receives all the necessary information from Interactor and passes it to Activity via View Interface. As I told you before we have implemented HomeScreenView interface in HomeScreenActivity to get all the information and update the User Interface.package viper.test.sampleapp;import android.view.Viewinterface HomeScreenView {fun displaySomething()}class HomeScreenPresenter {lateinit var activity: HomeScreenActivityfun presentSomething() {activity.displaySomething()}}5. HomeScreenRouter \u2014 Router is required to navigate from one screen to another.package viper.test.sampleapp;import android.content.Intentclass HomeScreenRouter {lateinit var activity: HomeScreenActivityfun navigateToActivity() {//        val intent = Intent(activity, TempActivity::class.java)//        activity.startActivity(intent)}}6. HomeScreenViewModel \u2014 Model is nothing but our pojo class required while parsing data from web api and has to store in pojo.package viper.test.sampleapp;class HomeScreenViewModel {class Request(aParam1: String, aParam2: String) {val param1: String = aParam1val param2: String = aParam2}class Response {}class DisplayedResult {}}Here we are done with how to create structure for particular feature using VIP + R design pattern.Note \u2014 This structure is for simple functionality but in case where you want to deal with Web Service then we need to create 2 more files to handle this.1. HomeScreenWorker2. HomeScreenServiceWorker class will be having all callback method of service and Service will be having all the API call.BENEFITS OF VIPER-All the modules are independent so VIPER is really good for large teams.-It makes the source code cleaner, more compact and reusable-It easier to adopt TDD (Test Driven Development)-You can add easily new features to the existing application without changing other modules possibly.-It can be applying SOLID principles.-Reduced number of merge conflicts.-It Makes it easy to write automated tests since your UI logic is separated from the business logicCONCLUSIONAfter MVP and MVVM I have started using VIPER for Android and IOS, I can safely say that the architecture is better than any other architecture and though its mainly designed for iOS but it works on Android too and it\u2019s worth it. The classes become smaller and more maintainable. It also guides the development process, because the architecture makes it clear where the code should be written.We are already using VIPER for one of our big application and after that it becomes very easy to understand the code structure. For new comer, it become very easy to understand the project flow without receiving KT.Hope you enjoyed this tutorial on the VIPER architecture pattern, and if you have any questions or comments, then feel free to contact me on mentioned Contact details.THAT\u2019S IT FROM THE PRESENTATION AREA THANK YOU", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Android", "Viper", "Viper Architecture", "VIP", "Design Patterns"]}, {"title": "Is Virtual Reality in Part Actual Reality: Striking Vipers", "post_link": "https://medium.com/her-outlette/is-virtual-reality-in-part-actual-reality-striking-vipers-47eaee11d270?source=search_post", "author_name": "Monet Victoria", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@monetvictoria", "publish_date": "2019-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-11", "readtime": "1.80", "claps": 31, "voters": 4, "content": "Is Virtual Reality in Part Actual Reality: Striking VipersMonet VictoriaFollowJun 11 \u00b7 2 min readI recently watched the latest installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror. I love this show because it reminds me so much of The Twilight Zone. It challenges societal norms and provides an underlying moral or warning about society.The first episode has literally left an effect on me for the last 4 days. Whenever there\u2019s a moment of free thought the episode creeps it\u2019s way back into my thoughts.This episode challenges our cookie cutter ideas around sexual orientation. We normally assume that if a man has sexual desires towards another man then he is automatically gay. Right? But wait no? This is especially taboo in the black community because well historically \u201cwe don\u2019t play that.\u201dThis black mirror episode plot has a very unique technology centered twist. Virtual sex between a male and female avatar being controlled by 2 black men. Pause. Break.As a preachers kid that grew up in a conservative household this blew my mind. Like how do I rationalize this and what bucket can I put this into. I grew up in an environment where labels are regular part of life.I\u2019ve definitely grown as a person and become extremely more welcoming working in New York City. I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to stop labeling people but I welcome content like this. A nice temperature check/refresher is a great reminder to not people in boxes. I\u2019ve realized the older I get if someone is gay, straight or indifferent it has no baring on me and it\u2019s none of my business.The second part of the episode that I really struggled with was the couples decision to have an open relationship at the end. Isn\u2019t the point of marriage to be with your one true love forever and ever? Have we really gotten to a point in society where we just have to indulge in all of our lust and passions. Where do we draw the line? I know it\u2019s a personal decision but to me it honestly makes no sense. Just be a lone wolf. I think this where the moral comes in about society.

VIPER has been used to build many large projects, but for the purposes of this article we will be showing you what is and why VIPER.Why VIPER?The question now in your mind why should i go to use a pattern beside MVC however this is the design pattern (MVC) that recommended and released by Apple.During the development process of iOS Application :You want to build the application on Single responsibility principle.You want to add, refactor or fix feature in something is maintainable.You want to reduce the dependency between layers.But, we have a common problem in using (Model-View-Controller) and i will call it fat controllers. Since some of business logic has been written and handled in the controller, handling UI presentation logic in the controller, managing UI components in the controller, navigation between screens. at the end we see a huge file which becomes very hard to manage specially if your project is to be scalable.VIPERClean Architecture divides an app\u2019s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers.VIPER architecture allows for a clearer separation of concerns and separates the viewController from handling most of the responsibility in an app. Concerns are separated into modules for each use case (i.e. provide a map for the user). Each module has a clear layer of routing logic, presentation logic and business logic.VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. The word VIPER means View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. helps you to make the structure.VIPER FlowView (UIView/UIViewController)Display info to the user and detects user interactions and perform animations.Owns and sends user actions to the presenter.Communicate with the presenter to perform these actions.InteractorAn Interactor represents a single use case in the app.It contains the business logic to manipulate model objects (Entities) to carry out a specific task.Fetches and stores data from a manager class like DataManager or NetworkManagerInteractor should be independent of any UI.PresenterThe presenter receives user actions from the View/ViewController and decide one of three things :Fetching data from Interactor (contains business logic) and preparing data for presentation and pass it back to the View/ViewController so i can update the view.Prepare data direct without fetching anything from the the Interactor and pass it back again to the View.Will use the Router to perform the navigation.EntityThe entities are our data models (i.e. Post, Room, New).These entities are manipulated by the Interactor.The Interactor has full knowledge of the entities and their properties.The Interactor never passes entities to the presentation layer.RouterRoutes from one screen to another are defined in the wireframes created by an interaction designer.The responsibility for Routing is shared between two objects: the Presenter, and the wireframe.A wireframe object owns the UIWindow, UINavigationController, UIViewController, etc.A wireframe is responsible for creating a View/ViewController and installing it in the window.The Presenter contains the logic to react to user inputs and knows when to navigate to another screen, and which screen to navigate to. Meanwhile, the wireframe knows how to navigate. So, the Presenter will use the wireframe to perform the navigation. Together, they describe a route from one screen to the next.The wireframe is also an obvious place to handle navigation transition animations.My view about VIPERVIPER is an architecture pattern which helps you to separate your logic when your app is very large and scalable but take care:You have to write down a lot of code.You have a lot of files in your project.Communication between layers become a little difficult.If you have a small project and not scalable i recommend to use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).ReferenceArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPER \u2014 ObjC", "responses": 1, "tags": ["iOS", "Swift", "Design Patterns", "Viper", "Clean Architect"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@gcharlesxoxo/like-a-viper-amongst-virgins-so-will-you-be-amongst-mortals-73e5f31e402e?source=search_post", "author_name": "M.A. Martin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gcharlesxoxo", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-24", "readtime": "0.93", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "M.A. MartinFollowMay 19, 2017 \u00b7 1 min read\u201cLike a viper amongst virgins, so will you be amongst mortals,\u201d. \u201cDamned of the abyss, pay homage to your Queen, for her banner waves in my honor and sustains me with her hate and lust.\u201d \u201cMy Queen you shall be,\u201d said the darkness. \u201cYour lust sends forth its fragrance; a sweet sinful smell to me.

Do you meditate in silence or use meditation music?Usually, people do in silence but, meditating via music can help you achieve a deeper state of meditation. Even though, there are a lot of meditation methods that can work at different times to bring you to a state of peace and presence in the NOW. You may have read a lot about meditation online, but never ever had a post on meditation music, so I thought it would be a good time to make an article for selecting a music for meditation.Let`s have a look at the connection between sound and stillness.Soothes and Stills Your MindIf you\u2019ve never tried before \u2014 meditating with music, Woozy Viper highly recommends it. However, there are a few, let\u2019s say, \u2018parameters\u2019 to follow. The most important of these is that you have to use music that soothes and stills your mind. Whereas music like heavy metal, rock, pop, jazz or the blues, these can be too harsh, distracting, fast-paced or depressing to help you get to deeper mind states.Avoid MemoriesAnother important factor from Woozy Viper that is essential to consider during meditation \u2014 no pun intended. If you\u2019ve got some music that you love, but it reminds you of specific people, periods or events in your life, avoid them. Let`s know the reason \u2014 these tunes will trigger your memories, which trigger associations, feelings, and thoughts. Then, before you know it, you\u2019re not meditating at all, you\u2019re just thinking. Worse than that, if that string of associations turns sour, then you\u2019re \u2018just thinking\u2019 and feeling stress!Choosing a Meditation MusicWhen it comes to choosing a meditation music, a quick Google search will give you an idea of just how many choices you have. You\u2019ve got YouTube choices, free downloads, sacred chants, binaural beats, instrumental shoot, there\u2019s probably even some musak being promoted as music for meditation. The thing is, you want to choose music that suits what you want to achieve during meditation. So if you want to relax and still your mind, then calm, soothing music is best. If you want to re-energize after a long day, something melodic and gently uplifting will do. If you want to deepen your spirituality, then sacred chants might appeal to you. Also, if you want to go into deep mind states like Theta and Delta, then you\u2019ll want to get some binaural beats and use a headset.Ambient SoundsHow about using the sound of rain or waves or bells? Does this count as music for meditation? It sure does! Just remember that this kind of ambient, almost \u2018white noise\u2019 sounds, can quickly calm you right past meditation and into sleep. So if you\u2019re using ambient sound audios for the purpose of meditation, be sure to sit in a position that keeps you awake.Your Valuable Feedback!After reading the above guide from Woozy Viper, if you are going to use music to enhance your meditation. Please share your valuable comments on it \u2014 How it works, and what kind of music helped you?Originally Posted: https://www.allperfectstories.com/woozy-viper-guide-choose-use-meditation-music/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Meditation"]}, {"title": "Pecunia populi", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jan_jan/pecunia-populi-722c81835d6b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dr. Jan-Jan van der Vyver", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jan_jan", "publish_date": "2017-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-02", "readtime": "4.76", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "Pecunia populior: How I learned to stop worrying, and love a tax integrated national cryptocurrency.Dr. Jan-Jan van der VyverFollowAug 7, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readPart 1: lower taxation with better government auditability.Our current economic system has done great things for us. The device you are reading this on is one of them. But, our economic system is not a panacea. We have some real problems, which include:profit shiftingcost of tax compliancelosses due to unreported taxesthe high cost of tax collectiongovernment departments failing financial audits, i.e., tax spending being unaccounted forIn this first article in the series, we are going to look at how a cryptocurrency with built-in per transaction taxation can make all these problems disappear. In fact I will argue that nation states should switch as quickly as possible to a per state cryptocurrency with built-in per transaction taxation, and we as the public should demand it, becauseit lowers tax rates significantly, andgreatly improves government fiscal honesty (through auditability).First, to delve deeper into the problems we are going to take a look at America as a case study. If you look at your own country you should be able to find similar data.Profit shifting is a major problem. Multinational corporations shift profits into low- and no-tax countries, to reduce their taxes and increase shareholder value. A company like Apple paid as little as 1.9% in taxes on their profits outside the US. In America in 2012 the estimated corporate tax revenue lost due to profit shifting was between $77 billion and $111 billion. Measured against the actual corporate tax revenue of $242 billion that is between 32% and 45% of value lost. What this means for national companies and the population of a nation state, is that this increases the tax burden on them. Furthermore, with profit shifting, poorer countries lose more than rich countries, which increases the burden on those who can least afford it.In 2012 the rate of change to, and the inherent complexity of, tax laws costs the American economy an estimated $1 trillion. Measured against the total revenue collected by the federal government in that year of $2.5 trillion, this is 40%.On top of this it is estimated that the US Treasury annually loses out on $450 billion in unreported taxes.The budget for the US Treasury in 2012 was $128 billion.So let\u2019s summarize these numbersprofit shifting tax loss = $ 111 billionunreported taxes = $450 billioncost of collection = $128 billionIf we can reduce these numbers to zero, and measure that against the tax revenue, it results in a potential reduction of 28% in tax rates. This is a strong economic imperative to solve these problems.To reduce taxation it is not enough to make the process of tax collection fair and effective, how taxes are spent also needs to be improved. Now I\u2019m going to pick on the US military. The Department of Defence cannot account for$8.5 trillion in tax money doled out to them between 1996 and 2012. If you consider the unaccounted for as losses (you should), then that amount averaged over 6 years could have decreased taxes in 2012 by 57%.The above taken together would result in a 85% decrease in tax rate.Just to get a real feel for that: imagine that for every $100 you paid the government last year you put $85 back in your pocket instead.Our economic imperative has just become a very strong motivator.So let\u2019s see how a cryptocurrency with built-in per transaction taxation can make all these problems disappear, and reduce the taxes you need to pay by 85% :-)Cryptocurrencies are basically the internet of money. Like cash you don\u2019t need a bank, or another trusted third party, to transact.I am going to use Monero as an example, because it already exists. Like cash Monero is private. That is if I pay you using Monero, then no-one else can see that transaction. So, transacting in Monero meets our current privacy requirements.What we are going to do is imagine a Monero+ where every transaction is taxed. I.e., for every transaction x% gets paid to the government. Note that with Monero+ no-one knows you and I did business, but the government has gotten their tax payment automatically and immediately.To implement Monero+ is \u201ctrivial\u201d. Me paying you using a cryptocurrency is already a transaction. All we are doing is automating the addition of a third party, i.e., the tax revenue service.This makes profit shifting impossible. Because we now automatically tax the transaction instead of the company profit. As long as we are doing business in the currency of our nation state, taxes are paid. Immediately and with zero effort.This also reduces the cost of compliance to zero. You never need to complete a tax return ever again. Read that sentence again.Tax interaction is now reduced toThose who have to pay additional taxes, e.g., tobacco, alcohol, sugar, polluters.Those who want to claim taxes back.Using Monero+ there is no such thing as unreported taxes!This also means that taxes do not need collecting. I.e., the cost of collecting taxes reduces to zero; it is built into the system. The only costs now are the deviations: those who are taxed extra and those who are claiming back.So Monero+ gives us our 28% reduction in taxes. Because it is a cryptocurrency it can also give us the other 57% through inherent auditability.Monero is not just like cash, because it is a cryptocurrency it is also its own complete accounting ledger. Let\u2019s consider the Department of Defence again: They get allocated a budget in Monero+. When they get audited their Monero+ accounting ledger shows every amount spent, and the people who approved each cent. Who got paid is secret, but who paid is not. With Monero+ individuals can be held accountable. You can even make referencing invoices on Monero+ a requirement for the DoD to make the auditability really simple. If the political will exists then thieves can be easily prosecuted, and the misspent reduced to zero.You might wonder how there can be accounting ledgers and privacy at the same time. The short answer is mathematics is amazing. If you are interested in the details please read up on the Monero website.Please note I am not saying a nation state should adopt Monero, rather a nation state should fork a cryptocurrency like Monero and add per transaction taxation.In conclusion: a national cryptocurrency with per transaction taxation will greatly increase our tax efficacy and efficiency, and so vastly reduce our tax burden. Monero+ would create a more honest government (if the political will exists) while we pay a fraction of the taxes we currently do. Imagine what that increase in disposable income will do for your economy. In 2012 in America, combined with the $1 trillion saved from the reduction in tax complexity, Monero+ would\u2019ve meant a disposable income cash injection of roughly $3 trillion with zero negative effect on government efficacy.In the next article we will investigate how Monero+ would effect our current economy, and what new financial possiblities Monero+ opens up for us.PS. I cheated.

2018Architecting an app is not an easy decision, many factors should be considered when building an app, after all following an MVC or MVVM will cover a part of what you are trying to solve but there is no silver bullet and still there will be need to think about how to build and architect the business layer and data layer more effectively, multiple articles did discuss the pros and cons of famous app patterns, like this one in Medium, it is good to use your software engineering skills in building a maintainable, modular, scalable, testable robust app.I will address mainly the MVC, MVVM, MVP and VIPER patterns through building this simple very common use case with each one:- Display a list of simple media objects (Photo + Title) in a grid, Data is retrieved through a restful api call from :https://api.jsonbin.io/b/5a78d81704b9c21255e40363Now lets start with VIPER, the diagram below should give you an overview of how classes are structuredFollowing a POP(Protocol Oriented Programming) approach, The VIPER stack will be declared in protocols presenting input and output for every entity, mainly the following protocols:InteractorInput ProtocolInteractorOutput ProtocolPresenterInput ProtocolPresenterOutput ProtocolWireframe ProtocolOther protocols might be added according to the use case, e.g. ViewControllerDelegate or e.g.DataManagerProtocolNow breaking the diagram above :View: mainly UIView objects, nib files, Storyboards, ViewControllers.The ViewController manages different UI Objects (e.g. CollectionViews, DataSources), normally it is the source of view objects and it conforms to the PresenterOutput where communication is done through it.for our use-case, I used the following files to manage the view layer:AdvertismentsViewController.swiftAdvertisementCollectionViewCell.swiftAdvertismentsCollectionViewDataSource.swiftPresenter: consists of two protocols PresenterInput and PresenterOutput protocols, The Presenter class conforms to PresenterInput and InteractorOutput, The presenter class communicates withRouter/Wireframe for UI Navigation , one of the most important roles of the Presenter is to provide the View layer with models ready for presentation.Interactor: consists of two protocols InteractorInput, InteractorOutput, Interactor class conforms to InteractorInput Protocol and the output is a delegate property in the presenter, the Interactorcommunicates with the outer world of data and carries business logic, target is to convert Simple DTOs retrieved from Data Layer to App Modelsif you don\u2019t have lots of time to do tests ( which is really bad) make sure to at least cover the Interactor class properly, as the business logic happens here.Entity: What the Interactor communicates with to retrieve data, this could be the Data Access layer and Simple Plain Models (note some writers/bloggers consider the DataAccessLayer to be part of the Interactorand that Entity are the simple plain objects only, It is really up to you how you would divide the architecture.Router: responsible for navigation and hooking, Communicates only with the PresenterThe folder structure screenshot might also be helpful:Where to go from here?This is just a one use case, however it scales smoothly, I would advise to use the same strategy but with a cluster for use cases , having a root wireframe and cluster wireframe, at the beginning VIPER might be confusing and takes some time to grasp, but it is really beneficial in maintaining and developing a modular code base.IMO also it might not be always the best solution, I recommend it for application which are expected to grow largely and with many contributors, but for small limited number of screen apps, it might make sense to go with a faster approach such as MVVM or MVCThe full code for the developed use case can be found here", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Swift", "Software Design Patterns"]},

look back on this soon-to-be-over NHL offseason, there are a few veteran names (namely Jaromir Jagr, Jerome Iginla and Shane Doan) that haven\u2019t yet inked a contract. Why aren\u2019t teams biting on these still-serviceable, good hockey players.Lee VynerFollowAug 10, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readReddit user: nam_ezeehcThe age-old, grizzled veteran is a dying breed in today\u2019s NHL with the influx of young talent like Conor McDavid, Auston Matthews, Patrick Laine and many others. These younger players, even teenagers, are dominating the league. Imagine, a player like Sid \u201cThe Kid\u201d Crosby is now considered long-serving veteran\u2026 he\u2019s barely 30 years old! Even discussions around the league about Alex Ovechkin are stating that he\u2019s losing a step in this fast-paced league.In my younger days, I remember watching Maple Leafs games with my father and brother. Shouting at the TV as Jaromir Jagr scored against \u201cus\u201d while he was with the Rangers, Capitals, Penguins, Flyers and even the Panthers. Fast forward a decade or two, and the league\u2019s 2ND ALL-TIME LEADING SCORER is without a job. This is a man, nay a living legend, who played all 82 games last season, scored 16 goals and had 46 points. Quite commendable for a 45-year old forward. Yet, it seems that it\u2019s now a question of foot speed that is keeping him out of the league and off of our televisions. I can\u2019t help but feel, even though he\u2019s older now, there are still be a couple teams out there that could use his services (i.e. Montreal, Brooklyn/New York or even Calgary).Paul Chiasson / The Canadian PressIggy! Man oh man, Iggy. Jarome Iginla was/is one of my favorite players to watch. He could beat you with his wicked shot or beat the crap out of you with his fists. Other than Jagr, he is the only member of the 600+ goal club that\u2019s still active in the NHL.He\u2019s a leader and a fighter. Lest we forget so quickly, who set up Crosby for the famous Golden Goal in Team Canada\u2019s illustrious history. Sadly, Iggy would be a great fit in only two cities I can think of. He would look great in Ranger Blue or back home, where he planted his star roots, as a Calgary Flame.Then there is the lesser of these three players in regards to statistics, but nothing can be taken away from one of the best captains in NHL history, \u201cMr. Coyotes/Jets,\u201d Shane Doan. The man is just a physical beast and can still skate with the league. Maybe he\u2019s just finished, but there is only one team that he should join in my opinion, and that\u2019s the Jets in Winnipeg. What a story that would be, the prodigal son returning home. This is a player that could help with a team that is dying for leadership (nothing against Blake Wheeler).Hockey fans can all see that the game is changing. It\u2019s only getting faster and faster, which is great for us fans, but the down side is that the star players of my youth are being dwindled away into retirement. Such is the cycle of a sports fans life.See you all in the regular season.

Network that was created by the Golden Frog Inc Company in 2009. VyprVPN is an individual and its fundamental job is to verify the online personality of clients and any information that is being taken care of from security breaks and information snoopers.It\u2019s anything but an obscure certainty that surfing the web is a less secure action than it was a very long time back. As innovation advances to take off new items and change the world into computerized mode, the innovation of programmers keeps on improving. Thusly, the requirement for a safe methods for perusing winds up inescapable. A Virtual Private Network is a standout amongst the best arrangements of online security. A Virtual Private Network is essentially a method for verifying your web association through information encryption. VyprVPN is a mechanically progressed Virtual Private Network that fills in as a line of safeguard against any security interruptions on the web.VyprVPN being a virtual private system works in a straightforward way. The fundamental thought is to encode information and traffic so that with the goal that the Internet Service Provider just gets to he scrambled information. VyprVPN profits a methods through which information can be encoded. Once scrambled, the information will seem to have come initially from any of the worldwide VPN server areas. The end beneficiary of the scrambled information will at that point get to the IP address data and the VyprVPN server area rather than the first server area. This makes it harder for programmers to follow the first wellspring of the information and thusly averts security breaks and profound information parcel investigation from suspicious elements.When you are utilizing Golden frog for your Vypr VPN, you are at a favorable position. Brilliant Frog has a lot of servers over the globe. As a Golden Frog client, you can pick your IP area from any of their servers in Europe, America and Asia-Pacific. As of late, they even uncovered another server in Austin Texas. Furthermore, the Golden Frog Vypr VPN is entirely adaptable and joins pretty much every type of information on the web from informing and anti virus administrations to remote and VoIP. This makes it helpful to get to verify perusing paying little mind to what you are doing on the web.VyprVPN as a line of protection against online security breaks is exceptionally viable. This is on the grounds that it profits every one of the advantages of secure web perusing without meddling with speed. Accordingly, it is an entirely attractive method of secure web based perusing.Visit Our Website: http://www.vpnbeats.com/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Best Vpn", "Best Vpn Services", "Vpn Service Providers", "Best Vpn Service Uk", "Openvpn Access Server"]}, {"title": "A Modern Shading Language", "post_link": "https://medium.com/velan-studios/a-modern-shading-language-92478423e5f8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Viper Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ViperTeam", "publish_date": "2019-07-15", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-08", "readtime": "5.16", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "A Modern Shading LanguageViper TeamFollowJul 15 \u00b7 6 min readHigh-level shading languages (GLSL, HLSL, MetalSL, etc\u2026) are one of the few areas in games and graphics programming that, despite their name, are still very low level and have evaded tighter, more meaningful integration with applications. There have been past attempts to provide richer semantic information, but those are largely couched in the realm of being wrappers over an existing language: e.g. FX and Cg. The biggest issue with this approach is that the semantic information isn\u2019t a first-class citizen of the language. These wrappers are just fancy variations on the C preprocessor, which by definition makes them lossy. What we really want is a language that has application-level semantics built into it. Let\u2019s start by examining why, especially through the lens of game development.MotivationMany game developers make games for multiple platforms. Some of them stay in the safe zone of Windows, PS4, and Xbox One. This is really beneficial from a shader standpoint because HLSL (or a close variant thereof) can be used on all three of these platforms. In a lot of cases, the PC version won\u2019t have additional features that necessitate different shaders. That being said, there\u2019s still the possibility that different hardware optimizations will be chosen for each, making platform-specific code necessary. There are also developers that release games across a wider range of platforms, including iOS, Android, Linux, MacOS, etc. This brings in other shader languages including desktop GLSL, GLSL ES, and Apple\u2019s Metal Shading Language. With this, the problem of supporting multiple platforms becomes much more pressing. Whereas with the first situation you\u2019d be able to just use #defines for blocks of platform-specific functionality, you now need to either have some sort of conversion pipeline, or manually author multiple, platform-specific shaders.Fortunately, for developers that just need something to work right now, there\u2019s a rich ecosystem of solutions for shader conversion and cross-compilation:hlsl2glslfork \u2014 (now outdated) Converts DX9 HLSL to various types of GLSL. The best that was available for a long time.HLSLParser \u2014 Originally written by Unknown Worlds for Natural Selection 2, converts DX9 HLSL to DX10 HLSL, GLSL, and Metal Shading Language.HLSLcc \u2014 What Unity uses for shader conversion now. Converts HLSL bytecode to GLSL, GLSL ES, Vulkan GLSL, and Metal Shading Language.glslang \u2014 Tool for converting GLSL to SPIR-V. HLSL front-end is in development.SPIRV-Cross \u2014 Converts SPIR-V to GLSL, Metal Shading Language, and in the future, HLSL.glsl-optimizer \u2014 Optimizes GLSL code, and can also translate GLSL to Metal Shading Language.Where Existing Solutions Fall FlatThere\u2019s a couple problems with the above solutions. The first is that cross-platform support isn\u2019t really there. Things like pixel-local storage and framebuffer fetch are encoded through specific usage patterns instead of with function calls. This is honestly a terrible approach because it requires knowledge of something with a magical outcome: i.e. a given, very specific configuration will translate into the desired usage in the output, but it must match exactly. It also means that the language semantics need to be further overloaded to work with future platform-specific extensions. The second problem is that HLSL is largely viewed as the \u201cright\u201d language to use as the input language. While I definitely agree that it has better syntax and semantics than GLSL, it\u2019s not without its own problems, especially with regards to type safety and safety in general. Additionally, the existence of wrappers like Cg and FX should make it obvious that HLSL doesn\u2019t have any real application-level facilities. What I mean by application-level is features for users that aid in developing applications: e.g. support for variations of a shader with/without a given feature (henceforth called \u201cvariants\u201d), material-level features (stuff like constant buffer header creation/serialization), and render-pass level features (techniques). These are all possible in some form in FX and Cg, but they\u2019re not tightly integrated and instead applied as a layer above the shader code itself.Managing ComplexityThe last aspect of all of this, largely motivated by prior experience with a codebase of very complicated shaders with many variants controlled by boolean feature definitions, is a desire to discourage use of the preprocessor as much as possible. It\u2019s a rather natural leap to want to control enabling/disabling features of a shader through the use of preprocessor definitions, especially since the preprocessor is the most powerful metaprogramming tool that current shading languages have available. The problem with this is that it\u2019s a lossy transformation. Let\u2019s say you want to know what samplers and uniform buffers are used by a given configuration of a shader. Using the preprocessor for variants means that you\u2019ll need to build and then reflect the information from every single variant, the union of which is the information that you wanted to know. If your shader has thousands of variants you\u2019ll need to compile all of them just to get this information, meaning that your shader build is potentially now a bottleneck for your material build.The alternative here is having variants be a first-class citizen of the language, such that an un-varianted version of a shader already represents the union of all possible shaders that can be generated from it. In practice, this means having some type called Variant that the user uses like any other type (with some semantic restrictions).An additional aspect of having extra semantic information in the shader is that we can even strip unnecessary vertex inputs based on their usage in the pipeline. For example, if texture mapping is an optional feature, we can strip not only the code to do the texture fetches from the pixel shader, but also the code to read/copy/generate the texture coordinates themselves from the vertex shader. This same idea extends naturally into deeper pipelines which include geometry or tessellation shaders. In current systems, this can be achieved through having defines in vertex input structures to eliminate elements. In this system, it would be automatic and would require no additional work besides the user varianting the code in the pixel shader.What We Want In a LanguageIn light of all of this, I propose writing a new high-level language, designed around some core tenets:Strong, static typing.Include/module system.Familiar syntax for C/C++ developers.Platform-specific constructs represented in a uniform way (through intrinsics).Variants as a first-class language construct.Abstract intermediate representation.Ability to transpile to many different platform languages from a single source unit.Human-readable transpiled output (to aid debugging).If we look to the design of Apple\u2019s Metal Shading Language (from a software engineering standpoint), it fits the first four points pretty well. The reason for this is that it\u2019s a modified subset of C++ parsed with a special version of Clang. I propose that this is currently the best direction to go in when developing this new language: a modified subset of C++, parsed by an existing, well-tested parser (Clang). I imagine the pipeline as looking like [Clang] -> [Abstract Representation] -> [Backend Transpilers].What an Intermediate Representation Gets UsSince we\u2019d have an intermediate representation, there are all sorts of interesting things that could be done:An actual module system with transpile/link-time optimization.Node-based shader editor that uniformly mixes user code and engine/tool-provided shader nodes.Output to non-GPU languages such as actual C++. This enables having a software rasterizer that has feature parity with a GPU rasterizer, with little to no additional effort on the part of the shader authors.Perform optimizations that aren\u2019t currently possible in platform-level languages due to missing or incomplete semantic information.ConclusionHopefully I\u2019ve made clear the case for having a shader language beyond what the various platform langauges offer, and moving to an authoring model that treats the platform-level shading languages as something akin to assembly: a low-level language to compile to rather than author directly. There are definitely benefits beyond what I\u2019ve outlined that this approach offers and having control over the language (versus dealing with a platform/API vendor) opens the door to implementing high-level constructs that the platform vendors wouldn\u2019t consider approaching.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Programming", "Viper Engine", "Game Development"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano/energy-cannot-be-created-or-destroyed-c7e8574b9af7?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vyner Mano", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano", "publish_date": "2019-08-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-28", "readtime": "0.68", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "You might actually be immortal according to quantum mechanics.4.1K31Jeremie HarrisVyner ManoFollowAug 28 \u00b7 1 min readEnergy cannot be created or destroyed.

Obviously, it protects your head from any bumps or shots and allows for extra gear to be mounted on\u2013including night vision.There are many replicas available on the market, from the cheap plain helmets with limited comfort and customisation to more expensive ones and those that are built better.Thanks to Military1st we had the chance to try out the Viper Fast Helmet which is a replica of the Ops-Core FAST XP High Cut helmet.HelmetI don\u2019t think anybody needs an introduction to what an Ops-Core FAST helmet is. Everybody knows them and they are very common to see on the airsoft battlefield\u2013at least the replica ones.The model we were testing was the in olive drab colour. Unlike most of other units from FMA or Emerson, that normally come in ranger green, this one looked much nicer. You can tell by the rails sections on the sides that it\u2019s painted. Most other manufacturers only provide a Multicam version that\u2019s painted\u2013the rest of the them come with the plastic in a particular colour. This actually is a good thing as it creates a much better looking layer.The helmet comes with the standard set of accessories: side rails, Head-Loc attachment points for glasses, 2 rail segments, night vision shroud which is a plastic replica of the Ops-Core VAS shroud and the padding.The padding is the most interesting bit simply because it\u2019s the best padding system I\u2019ve seen in the replica helmets. It\u2019s much thicker and therefore much more comfortable. Just for this thing alone, the Viper helmet is worth getting instead of any other replica.The bungee retention system looks to be more solid too. I\u2019ve broken pretty much every single bungee from any other brand. The Viper ones are still there!The helmet shell is also much thicker. It replicates the weight a bit better and feels more sturdy and also helps when attaching any other shrouds or night vision mounting systems as they usually expect the shell to be thick anyway. I\u2019ve tried attaching a Norotos 3-point shroud and it works great.The whole liner kit looks at feels sturdy as well. The quality of the straps is good with double stitching in the important places, the chin strap has a nice piece of softer fake leather to improve the comfort. The buckle is not great and sometimes can be hard to disconnect\u2013a minor annoyance.The only issue I had, was with the adjustment dial at the back. It just does not hold its position well, and any faster movement of your head and it would slightly undo itself. This was especially evident when having night vision on the front of the helmet and a battery pack on the back. Basically, any added weight to the helmet would result in slow undoing of the tension.What was a really nice addition, was the fact that the included instructions were also very helpful. Two colour leaflets had great information on how to adjust the helmet to your shape and size of your head but also, how to properly install a headset system, such as Peltor Comtacs\u2013a very nice touch!SummaryAll in all I really like the Viper FAST helmet. I was impressed with the quality of finish. The padding system is simply great and unseen in other replicas. I like the thickness of the shell and the liner set. Again, the only issue I had, was with the retention dial, and could be an issue with my particular model only.Originally published on TacticalTwo", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Tactical", "Airsoft", "Milsim"]}, {"title": "V\u00fdvar & rezance.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/u-kubistu/v%C3%BDvar-rezance-fb175ac02129?source=search_post", "author_name": "U Kubistu", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@okorinek", "publish_date": "2016-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-15", "readtime": "2.24", "claps": 4, "voters": 4, "content": "V\u00fdvar & rezance.U KubistuFollowApr 13, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readNajlep\u0161\u00ed tradi\u010dn\u00fd \u201evypro\u0161\u0165ov\u00e1k\u201c, kurac\u00ed v\u00fdvar, sme spojili s tradi\u010dn\u00fdmi, p\u00f4vodom \u010d\u00ednskymi alkalick\u00fdmi rezancami.Z\u00e1klad kubistick\u00e9ho jedla v\u017edy boli, s\u00fa aj bud\u00fa kvalitn\u00e9 suroviny.

We use both as a core part of our Viper technology. Both data structures are written in C99 and are fairly self-contained.Lock-Free Queue: vqueueOur lock-free queue is an implementation of the non-blocking queue in Michael and Scott\u2019s \u201cSimple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms\u201d paper. While this excellent paper is over 20 years old, it is not something we\u2019d seen cleanly implemented in our language of choice without calls to malloc() in the push operation.The queue supports three major operations:Push a void pointer on the queue.Pop a void pointer from the queue.Get the number of void pointers currently in the queue.The queue is lock-free and thread-safe. A push performs at least 3 atomic 64-bit compare-and-swap (CAS) operations and 1 atomic 32-bit increment. A pop on a non-empty queue performs at least 2 atomic 64-bit CAS operations and 1 atomic 32-bit decrement.We pre-allocate space for the capacity of the queue. There is 8 bytes of overhead for each item that the queue can hold.Lock-Free Integer Pool: vintpoolAfter writing the queue node allocator for vqueue, we decided to generalize the code slightly, and thus was born vintpool. One common pattern we have in Viper is managing a block of pre-allocated storage in a thread-safe way.thing_t things[k_max_things];    int alloc_thing() { /* Get an index to a free thing. */ }    void free_thing(int thing_index) { /* Marked an indexed thing as free. */ }This is the mission of vintpool, to manage pools of indexed resources. The pool supports two operations:Allocate an index.Free an index.Both operations are lock-free and thread-safe. Each operation incurs the overhead of at least 1 atomic 64-bit CAS. Storage for the pool is pre-allocated at a cost of 8-bytes per index.Where to Get the CodeThe code for vqueue and vintpool are up on GitHub now. If you use this code, please let us know. We\u2019d love to hear from you.You can reach the technology team at Velan by emailing viper@velanstudios.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Programming", "Viper Engine", "Game Development"]}, {"title": "The Seen & Unseen Forces: Cloud", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano/the-seen-unseen-forces-cloud-f0c0fb19e198?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vyner Mano", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano", "publish_date": "2019-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-01", "readtime": "2.87", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The Seen & Unseen Forces: CloudVyner ManoFollowMar 2 \u00b7 3 min readHuman being across the recorded 2000 calendar years has been improving and evolving when it comes to recording information and knowledge as well in storing the information for later reference due to the degree of importance of the information.We used to store information by just memorising as much as we can, but usually, that information is the thing that we usually apply and use in daily life, such as names, faces, places and directions. As technology progressed, human being starts to record information such as events and knowledge such as medical practices into papers and books. Papers and books are one of the greatest inventions in terms of technology and knowledge recording as well as knowledge transfer. Even after so many centuries, and in the 21st century, human beings still rely on papers and books to keep information, to put in notes, ideas and knowledge.As the years gone by, information is needed in an instant and covering so many distances, hence the internet is the one that is being used to store and share information across the globe and can be accessible at any time by any users.Human beings are getting smarter in getting information: in the beginning only handwritings, drawings and letters are possible to be recorded, humanity had push boundaries and able to record sound and real-world images. As the years went by, human beings are able to capture not only images but multiple images and frames in one timeframe which is basically what video is.All imaginary and videos at the earliest days are captured in films. As the technology advanced, imaginaries and videos can be recreated digitally. That is when binary fits into the story. As the computers are able to compute more binaries and numbers, the images and videos are able to be clearer and sharper. However, the clearer the picture or video, the more pixels and resolutions are needed, the more numbers and binaries involved, the more memories are needed to be stored.Storage of information progresses, from papers to filmstrips (Cassettes, VHS, USB drive). As the world needs bigger storage and meeting the demand to have memories and information readily accessible, plus with the fact of the presence of wireless internet: the newest technological achievement is the creation of cloud storage.Cloud storage\u2019s main idea is just like the name itself, it is to store memories in \u2018the cloud\u2019 because you don\u2019t have to have your own hardware to keep the memories. You just need the internet to have the memories transferred from your computer or devices into the cloud storage.This is quite similar to faith.Faith is like an internet connection, you have to be able to connect to it and recognise that there is something out there. The storage is like something that you don\u2019t possess. You are entrusting your faith by saving the memories in the cloud storage. The cloud storage is analogous to the higher being whom all your concerns go to if you let it. You can get the memories back if you make an effort to be connected to the internet and know where you keep it in and when you keep it. Miracles can happen to you and prayers can be answered, but you got to play your parts as well.Going towards a mini conclusion, there are many forces and powerful thing in our life that is involving science and faith are the unseen forces. But the forces that we can see in our life is also full of mysteries and there is so much more backstory of light that we would like to know more and to dive into. For now, we will make full use of it to enrich our lives and to make sense of our surroundings.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Science of Faith\u2019, where the concept of faith and God is explained via existing famous scientific theories and knowledge.Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Vyner Mano.

As he was in pursuit to a different city, he had the opportunity to reflect on his time in Vegas and rookie season as a D-league coach.Toppert has been to the Vegas Summer League before, but this was the first time he was there being affiliated with a team. He was tasked with doing what the Rockets asked him to do such as Summer League practices and training camp in Houston before the team laced up for competition.Toppert loved being around the coaches, in the meetings, and working with the players who could become Vipers in the fall, and having an opportunity to expand his knowledge on the the game of basketball from his peers. It\u2019s his duty as a coach to become the best he can, and in Vegas he did just that.It\u2019s quite obvious that most players playing in the Summer League in general won\u2019t be in the NBA right away. Most know that and view the NBA\u2019s summertime basketball season as job interviews for D-league teams, overseas clubs and making their presence known to NBA personnel for maybe a training camp invite or just being on their radar for the future.\u201cNot everybody at this summer league on our team is going to play in the NBA,\u201d Toppert said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the reality of it, there\u2019s not enough spots. There are guys out there that maybe the D-league is right decision for them, the right place for them to grow, and maybe they fit with what we\u2019re looking for.\u201dToppert views Summer League as an opportunity to see if prospective players have what it takes to become Rockets in the future and if it makes sense for select players to join the Vipers. It\u2019s a never-ending evaluation process because technology is constantly evolving, and more tools are becoming available to players and evaluators.Toppert loves the entire thrill of evaluating, and knows that basketball never sleeps. It\u2019s year round, played at every minute of everyday.The Vipers mean a lot to the RGV community and I think that\u2019s also what creates such a great atmosphere for usIn just a short year, he went from training NBA players and coaching youth, to becoming a teacher on the court and playing a vital role in the lives of the men he encounters. Toppert\u2019s rookie year in the D-league as a coach finished with the Vipers going 29\u201321 and losing to the Austin Spurs in round one of the playoffs. The season had its up and downs, but it\u2019s an experience he cherished greatly.\u201cSeason one was outstanding. We have, perhaps, the best situation from a D-league standpoint in the entire league,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great relationship with the Rockets and vice versa. The Rockets have always found value in the D-league, whether it\u2019s from a player perspective or a coaching perspective, which is very, very exciting. We understand what they expect out of us as a coaching staff and out of our team, and we have their full support. In addition to that, we have amazing support down in RGV.\u201dThere\u2019s a culture within the Vipers organization that makes everyone proud to be a member of the team in some capacity. A key to their successful relationship with Houston is the length of their relationship. The two parties have been an exclusive item since the 2009\u201310 season, before single affiliations became a must.Think about it like this: come the conclusion of next season, they\u2019ll have been together for three presidential terms. Now that\u2019s loyalty.\u201cThe Houston Rockets understand where the value is in the D-league and how they can provide value and receive value,\u201d Toppert said.\u201d I think that the Vipers understand that as well, and we\u2019re jus trying to slide and continue that tradition of excellence.\u201dToppert played a singular season in the D-league back in 2005\u201306 for the Albuquerque Thunderbirds, who are now known as the Canton Charge. The camaraderie, communication and transparency is something Toppert believes to be pretty rare in organizations, which makes the bond more special between the Vipers and Rockets, because it\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t really seen or been a member of.He directs all of the credit towards the general manager of the Vipers, Gianluca Pascucci. Toppert gushed over Pasucci\u2019s ability to put the team, roster and support staff together for the organization to achieve success.\u201cI learned how different it is to be a development coach for individuals and how it is to truly be a coach for a professional team,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I learned is how to build relationships, but balance a player\u2019s desire to expand their role, a player\u2019s desire to improve and to get out of the D-league with, perhaps, a role that they\u2019ve been given in our team concept. There are agendas in the D-league, and that\u2019s not a bad thing, because the D-league isn\u2019t a career league, it\u2019s more of a development and that means it\u2019s a temporary league.\u201dToppert has had experience in the player development world with players such as Nick Young, Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Myles Turner, Devin Booker and much more. Working out with young players is his forte, and a reason why he is one of the more prepared assistant coaches in the D-league and will be returning for a second season in Rio Grande Valley.He also coached at the academy and prep school level, which he credits for keeping him in a team concept. Doing so prior to joining Rio Grande Valley helped him gain the experience with duties such as before and after workouts, video breakdowns and more to become a success.A lot went down during Toppert\u2019s first season in the D-league, as a coach during the year and Summer League. He\u2019s ready for the 2016\u201317 season, as it\u2019s approaching quickly, and being a coach is a year round job. He loves his job, and most of all loves the fans who support the Vipers on a daily basis.\u201cThe Vipers mean a lot to the RGV community and I think that\u2019s also what creates such a great atmosphere for us,\u201d Toppert said.With just a few more months left of the offseason, Toppert\u2019s mind is set on speaking at a coaches clinic in New Mexico and a few camps if they\u2019re approved by the team. Being busy is what he loves, but wants to lay low for a bit then get back into the mix of things when the timing is right.As he leaves me to continue driving in the darkness, his next objective was to stay busy and handle his business by calling a coach .Originally published at sircharlesincharge.com on August 14, 2016.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Sports", "NBA", "Houston Rockets", "Rio Grande Vipers", "Cody Toppert"]}, {"title": "Jak jsem se pokou\u0161ela o vypracov\u00e1n\u00ed projektu", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@barbora.sulc.bohackova/jak-jsem-se-pokou%C5%A1ela-o-vypracov%C3%A1n%C3%AD-projektu-32cf64922793?source=search_post", "author_name": "Barbora \u0160ulc Boh\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@barbora.sulc.bohackova", "publish_date": "2017-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2017-11-22", "readtime": "6.33", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Jak jsem se pokou\u0161ela o vypracov\u00e1n\u00ed projektuBarbora \u0160ulc Boh\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1FollowNov 19, 2017 \u00b7 7 min read\u2026aneb nikdy mne tolik nebavilo n\u011bco, co mi ne\u0161lo\u2026zat\u00edm\u2026Ahoj,tenhle p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvek slou\u017e\u00ed jako v\u00fdstup m\u00e9ho sna\u017een\u00ed Digit\u00e1ln\u00ed akademie.SPOILER alert: Projekt se (zat\u00edm) nepoda\u0159ilo dokon\u010dit.Pokud jste sem zav\u00edtali omylem a nev\u00edte, co to je Digit\u00e1ln\u00ed akademie, tak se to m\u016f\u017eete do\u010d\u00edst na str\u00e1nk\u00e1ch neziskov\u00e9 organizace Czechitas. :) A ur\u010dit\u011b se p\u0159ihlaste na jeden z jejich kurz\u016f!Od za\u010d\u00e1tkuCel\u00fd tenhle koloto\u010d za\u010dal ve chv\u00edli, kdy jsem se dozv\u011bd\u011bla, \u017ee jsem byla p\u0159ijat\u00e1 do DA.

P\u016fvodn\u011b jsme se je\u0161t\u011b bavili o Geocoding Augmentation, ale to vzhledem k tomu, \u017ee m\u00e1m jen p\u011bt adres, nebude nutn\u00e9.Tak jsem si vytvo\u0159ila sv\u016fj bucket, nastavila vybran\u00e9 soubory jako input maping, vytvo\u0159ila si Sandbox a \u010dekala na z\u00e1zrak.

Avizovan\u00e9 ceny na bilboardech a netu byly samoz\u0159ejm\u011b \u201cod\u201d a jeliko\u017e my chceme Night safari a ZOO, tak je cena 71 SGD na jednoho.

Po projet\u00ed cel\u00e9 trasy je mo\u017enost si safari proj\u00edt znovu po sv\u00fdch, av\u0161ak jin\u00fdmi trasami, kter\u00e9 se jen ob\u010das p\u0159ek\u0159\u00ed\u017e\u00ed s trasou vl\u00e1\u010dku.

Jedna byla t\u011bsn\u011b nad n\u00e1mi na v\u011btvi a jeden z o\u0161et\u0159ovatel\u016f zrovna na protilehl\u00e9 stromy v\u011b\u0161el kbel\u00edky s potravou. Rozhodli jsme se \u010dekat a sledovat. Nijak jsme na veverku nemluvili, co\u017e jeden z n\u00e1v\u0161t\u011bvn\u00edk\u016f za n\u00e1mi zkusil a o\u0161et\u0159ovatelka ho dost slu\u0161n\u011b zpra\u017eila, \u017ee veverky nejsou cvi\u010den\u00e9, a\u0165 ji laskav\u011b nech\u00e1 let\u011bt, a\u017e sama uzn\u00e1 za vhodn\u00e9. Po chv\u00edli na\u0161tvan\u011b ode\u0161el, my st\u00e1le \u010dekali. A nakonec jsme se po p\u00e1r minut\u00e1ch do\u010dkali, veverka si popob\u011bhla po kmeni o kus v\u00fd\u0161e, znovu se rozhl\u00e9dla a p\u0159ipravila ke skoku a pak je\u0161t\u011b o dal\u0161\u00ed kus v\u00fd\u0161e. P\u0159\u00edpravila se ke skoku, odrazila, rozt\u00e1hla kon\u010detiny a t\u00edm bl\u00e1nu a kr\u00e1sn\u011b n\u00e1m nad hlavami proplachtila na protilehl\u00fd strom, kde j\u00ed \u010dekal kbel\u00edk potravy.Celkov\u011b se mi safari velmi l\u00edbilo. Cena je na na\u0161e pom\u011bry v\u0161ak p\u0159ehnan\u00e1. P\u016flnoc se bli\u017eila a tak jsem zkoumal na tabuli bus, kter\u00fd pojede nejbl\u00ed\u017ee k na\u0161emu bydlen\u00ed. Radoval jsem se kdy\u017e jsem v jednom z j\u00edzdn\u00edch \u0159\u00e1d\u016f na\u0161el Blk 617, co\u017e bylo \u010d\u00edslo na\u0161eho bloku (zji\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed z prvn\u00edho dne). Tato linka pr\u00e1v\u011b p\u0159ij\u00ed\u017ed\u011bla a tak jsme nasko\u010dili. Ten v\u0161ak odbo\u010dil na hlavn\u00ed na druhou stranu, ne\u017e jsme pot\u0159ebovali a o\u010dek\u00e1vali. \u0158\u00edkal jsem si, \u017ee nejsem p\u0159ece blb a vid\u011bl jsem jasn\u011b na\u0161\u00ed zast\u00e1vku v j\u00edzdn\u00edm \u0159\u00e1du a tak jsme na tla\u010d\u00edtko STOP ne\u0161ahali a jeliko\u017e nikdo jin\u00fd nevystupoval a na zast\u00e1vk\u00e1ch nikdo nest\u00e1l, jeli jsme d\u00e1l a d\u00e1l na v\u00fdchod ostrova. Po n\u011bkolika kilometrech \u010dek\u00e1n\u00ed, zda se bus obr\u00e1t\u00ed spr\u00e1vn\u00fdm sm\u011brem ji\u017e bylo pozd\u011b na v\u00fdstup, tak\u017ee jsme \u010dekali kam n\u00e1s zaveze a trochu s nap\u011bt\u00edm koukali do map. V\u011bt\u0161ina autobus\u016f toti\u017e kon\u010d\u00ed mezi p\u016flnoc\u00ed a jednou rann\u00ed. Kdy\u017e autobus projel okolo zast\u00e1vky Blk 617 bylo mi jasn\u00e9, \u017ee jsem dement, kter\u00e9mu jaksi nedo\u0161lo, \u017ee v cel\u00e9m Singapore nebude nejsp\u00ed\u0161e jen 999 blok\u016f (blok = po\u0159\u00e1dn\u00fd panel\u00e1k). Vzpomn\u011bl jsem si na n\u00e1\u0161 prvn\u00ed den v Singapore, kdy mi nejd\u0159\u00edve \u017eena, kter\u00e1 n\u00e1s vzala do auta a pot\u00e9 n\u00e1\u0161 hostitel vysv\u011btloval, \u017ee \u010d\u00edslo bloku jsou posledn\u00ed t\u0159i \u010d\u00edslice v PS\u010c. Ty prvn\u00ed t\u0159i \u010d\u00edslice v PS\u010c tam samoz\u0159ejme nejsou pro srandu kr\u00e1l\u00edk\u016fm \u017ee. A tak vystupujeme na nejblii\u017e\u0161\u00ed zast\u00e1vce a pt\u00e1me se na cestu k nejbli\u017e\u0161\u00ed zast\u00e1vce nadzemky (circle line).

If you are following news and articles about mobile application architecture you would definitely understand the huge movement of software engineers towards MVVM, MVP and VIPER.In my honest opinion, there is a huge gap between reading for a pattern and actually applying that. Especially with structural patterns as MVC, MVVM, VIPER, you will often catch yourself asking if a certain functionality belongs to the interactor or the presenter.In this article, we will try to explain the main entities that VIPER consists of, how they are connected and how to use them in a real-life application.One thing to rememberBefore you proceed I would like to clarify something:There is not a perfect pattern to structure your application.MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER or any other patterns have advantages and disadvantages. Given the fact that this article is focusing on the last one I have to say that VIPER is a very good choice for well designed and extensive projects. Personally, I consider VIPER ideal for big projects with well-defined criteria. The fact that VIPER is verbose and supports multiple layers might make less suitable for smaller projects than some other patterns. On the other hand, if the project is already extensive in use cases and flows, or intends to be, the reusability and testability of VIPER make it if not the best choice at least one of the finalists.Element ExplanationIf you ended up here, you might already have heard that VIPER was named after its main entities:ViewInteractorPresenterEntityRouter.If you are not familiar with the responsibilities related to each entity or if you want to refresh your knowledge please continue reading, otherwise feel free to skip this part.View:The main responsibility of this object is to host UI elements and capture the UI events. If a UI event is triggered (ex. a tap on a button) the view is responsible to propagate that event to the presenter. The view should not contain any business logic. The view could be either a UIViewController, UIView or even a UIControl if you want to be something complicated.Long story short: The view should never decide to do something. Any update on the view should be driven by the presenter.Presenter:The main responsibility of this class is to interpret UI events propagated from the view and populate the view with data it receives from the Interactor and contain UI related business logic. The interpretation of the events could be either asking the view to perform an action (ex. update the UI) or asking the Router to perform navigation logic. A presenter is dedicated to a view. Thus it is much easier to include inside the presenter the decisions for navigation and UI update. In case of a change in the UI the presenter is easier updated than the ViewController.Long story short: Inside the presenter you will find the logic that decidesIf there is any action that should be performed by the Interactor(s)If a navigation action should be performedIf the view should be updated and what would this update beThe presenter should be UIKit independentThe presenter has no notion of models and entitiesInteractor:This class operates as a provider for the requests of the presenter. It is responsible to provide the presenter with data fetched from local or remote databases and contains business logic related to Entities. Interactors should define a use case, be easily testable and be as reusable as they can be. Ideally, an interactor should be reused by different presenters, even different targets and projects without the need to change any code.Example: An Interactor responsible to perform a login action should be able to do that in an iOS, iPad and macOS application without any change.Long story short: Inside the interactor, you will see:Ways to retrieve data (network calls, database calls)Business logic functions (entity validations, entity transformations)Requests to other modules of the appNote: As we mentioned above, the interactor is responsible for entity manipulation. This does not mean that inside an interactor we are going to find functions that fetch data from the network or store data to a database. If you want to build your application in a clean way you should have different objects to perform this actions into separate layers. At the end you will need to inject these objects inside the interactor as dependencies, making the interactor completely testable.Router:This class is solely responsible for the navigation inside a project. It does not contain any kind of logic. Keeping the Router free of logic gives us the ability to have an easier tested navigation in unit test level.Entity:This class could be something like the Model in MVC or MVP but less functionality. It should contain the necessary properties and some functionality but in no way the same amount of functionality as it used to have in the aforementioned patterns.We try to gather as much functionality as possible in the interactor level. Having multiple small and reusable interactors fetching, storing or manipulating data increases the speed and productivity in the project. On the other hand that doesn\u2019t mean that the entity should be stripped down from functionality but it should contain functionality related only to the entity and nothing more.Note:Before I continue to explain how the main elements of are connected I would like to remind you that the true strength of VIPER is the separation of concerns.Connecting VIPERTrying to connect the VIPER elements is relatively easy, especially if you check the diagram posted above. The different elements of our architecture need to have a reference to one another. I order to avoid memory leaks please pay attention to the weak and strong connections between the elements.Even though the Presenter seems to be the centre of the VIPER architecture, when I think of VIPER I always prefer to start from the View.The View is only connected with the Presenter. It holds a strong reference to the Presenter. This is helpful for memory management as if the View is de-allocated there is no reason to have a presenter. Thus the presenter is going to be de-allocated as well.The Presenter, as you can see from the diagram above is connected to the View, the Router and the Interactor.In detail:The presenter holds a weak reference to the view, a strong reference to the Router and a strong reference to the interactor. The benefit of having something like this would keep the elements of router and interactor alive only for the needs of the presenter. If the view is deallocated then the presenter is going to be deallocated and in sequence the interactor and the router.The Router should not hold a reference to the presenter. It exists to aid the navigation requests of the presenter and nothing more.The Interactor knows about the entity. In some cases, the interactor might initialize an entity or in some other cases the interactor will fetch data and transform them into the entity.The Entity should be independent and agnostic of the interactor. It shouldn\u2019t connect to any other VIPER element.ConclusionTo sum up the VIPER pattern has the following:Plus:Separation of concernsIncreased testabilityIncreased reusabilityMinus:If the developers are not careful, the project my end up having spaghetti codeThe pattern is too verbose for small applicationsThe on boarding time for new members of the team might be higher as they need to adapt their way of working to VIPER.I hope you enjoyed the article.

But over time, there was something poking my brain and heart saying, \u201cChief, there\u2019s got to be a better way to write software. You need to up your game.\u201dIt was then that fateful day in 2014 that Mutual Mobile published an article on something called VIPER. I skimmed the article, and promptly and stubbornly moved onward having not actually messed with VIPER.Fast-forward to todayOver the years, I started to evolve my architecture choices. As many say, while there is no silver bullet, I now often find VIPER best suits my needs for applications with a clear direction and long-term vision. I truly love the modularity and how it makes the pain of unit testing in iOS go away (mostly).On my journey to VIPER\u2019ing, I hadn\u2019t really come across thorough and clean examples of implementation inside a cross-platform application. Therefore, I recently decided to write Listy \u2014 a to-do list app for iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS, and my first whole-app contribution to open source software \ud83c\udf89. I\u2019d love to share with you how I built it, and hope you find it helpful in your own software development adventures.If you\u2019re saying, \u201cLook, that\u2019s great, but I\u2019d rather just check out the code,\u201d here you go.Writing ListyThe inception of Listy came from a job interview take-home test. The purpose was to write a simple to-do list app which only creates and deletes lists and tasks, but spend the bulk of development time constructing a project foundation that would best serve scaling the app in future development \u2014 essentially laying down some rock-solid roots for a tiny tree to one day become a tall, beautiful one with many branches.Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t end up being a match, but I decided to continue development of Listy anyway for myself, and publish my findings in creating a cross-platform app with VIPER running underneath it. With a limited feature set, I wouldn\u2019t manage my daily to-dos with Listy, but I think it makes for a pretty nifty model home/reference guide for development of other projects!App structureAs with most iOS apps I build from scratch or refactor, the first thing I usually do is create a base Cocoa Touch framework to house primarily pure Swift and Foundation framework API interaction \u2014 custom data structures, extensions on Swift data structures, models, and data persistence \u2014 things we should be able to use and access in app extensions and anywhere else.I then create a second Cocoa Touch framework for handling all common UI(Kit) interaction \u2014 common views (i.e. view controllers), table view data sources/delegates, UI data structure convenience extensions \u2014 things we can use across many different use cases.Where does VIPER fit into this? Normally, my VIPER modules would be, in their entirety, in the iOS main app and extensions. With going cross-platform, where and how does it make sense to break apart the snake?Poorly drawn building blocksThe foundation layer, or ListyKitVIPER\u2019s presenter and interactor shouldn\u2019t even think about touching UIKit. The presenter should know when to present and update UI though (via the view and router), and the interactor should handle the business logic and CRUD\u2019ing entities\u00b9. Given how similar presenter and interactor behavior is for list and task management, I put them all in ListyKit, the base framework.\u00b2With the presenters and interactors at the base of all the Listy apps, in any app, I can do neat things like:Fetch list and task data, with which I can update my lists and tasks views.Tell lists and tasks views to update themselves, delete table view rows, and show error alerts.Have the router prepare to show edit list and edit task views.I also placed all router input and output protocols in ListyKit, but not any actual routers. I thought about including routers, but it would be going a bit overboard as routing is significantly different platform-to-platform. For example, when the user indicates to add a task, on iOS, we present a whole separate view, whereas on macOS, we add a table view row with a textfield to the list of tasks. You could use preprocessor conditionals to load different platform-specific code (and I do use a few elsewhere in the app), but felt things might get a bit too hairy in the router to do this. (And well, too many of these make things smelly.)The (iOS and tvOS) UI layer, or ListyUIBetween three different devices, the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV share a lot in common on the UI API front. Therefore, I had ListyUI sit on top of ListyKit, and offer the following:Set up, configure, and update all list and edit views.Reuse table view data source and cell configuration in all lists and tasks views.Share view routing output implementations (e.g. presenting/pushing/dismissing views).Present error alertsIn the updateView(\u2026) functions of each view, I perform block-based setups for cell configuration, selection, and deletion. This allows me to separate the table view data sources and delegates and from the view, while still being able to call to the presenter as needed when a user takes action.What about watchOS and macOS?Well, they\u2019re extra special, in that they have fancy things like WKInterfaceControllers and NSViewControllers, which our friends iOS and tvOS don\u2019t have. While we could, in theory, create some crazy master abstraction of views across all platforms, I thought it best to just handle UI interaction separately for watchOS and macOS. After all, we still have the \u201cIPE\u201d in VIPER available from ListyKit, which takes care of a lot of other heavy lifting.You mentioned cross-platform, yes?I initially assumed I could make ListyKit and ListyUI work cross-platform out of the box, but nay. I quickly found cross-platform frameworks are no walk in the park. Luckily, I discovered this very nice guide that helped me understand how to share code via platform-specific frameworks touching a shared Info.plist file (setup details are a bit out of the scope of this article, but I recommend checking out that article to learn more).I ended up setting up the following platform-specific frameworks:ListyKit iOSListyKit tvOSListyKit watchOSListyKit macOSListyUI iOSListyUI tvOSEach framework connects to the same code via sharing the aforementioned Info.plist path in Build Settings, and file target membership configuration. That is, each file still must be manually associated as needed with each platform framework. For example, ListsInteractor.swift must have a target membership of ListyKit iOS, ListyKit tvOS, ListyKit watchOS, and ListyKit macOS. If Apple launches a new augmented reality device, well, you might need to spend a few minutes check target membership boxes for ListyKit augmentedOS \u2014 not too bad.I can\u2019t draw hands. Brackets for source code though, no problem.In closingI\u2019m sure my VIPER implementation is not perfect across the board. If you see areas you think can be improved, I\u2019m all ears. In fact, I welcome your contribution! I plan to follow up this VIPER-specific article with other articles on how I made Listy, covering the specifics of things like abstracting view routing output and presenting error alerts. Also, if you like and want to use Listy code, please take it and run free-ish with it (it still has a license, yo). Thanks for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you found it helpful. Feel free to reach out for questions/thoughts in the comments! Listy on GitHubResourcesArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPERCreating Cross-Platform Swift Frameworks for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS\u00b9 Technically, one should not pass entities from the interactor back to the presenter, and create simple data structures associated with use cases. However, given the current entities in Listy are super small and simple, I decided to break this rule for now.\u00b2 One could argue presenters belong in ListyUI because they are UI-related functionality, despite not touching UIKit. While I agree, I felt it was a better trade-off to make them more easily reusable from ListyKit. If presentation logic for Listy becomes more complicated/platform-specific in the future, I will move them accordingly to individual app code.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Software Development", "Software Architecture", "Cross Platform"]}, {"title": "Broad In The Beam Is A Viper In My Bosom", "post_link": "https://medium.com/house-of-haiku/broad-in-the-beam-is-a-viper-in-my-bosom-ffc576f514d2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Anitha Sankaran", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@anitha02041989", "publish_date": "2019-09-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-23", "readtime": "0.47", "claps": 502, "voters": 13, "content": "Broad In The Beam Is A Viper In My BosomHaiku SeriesAnitha SankaranFollowSep 21 \u00b7 1 min readImage by Josch13 from PixabayThe thick brow furrowsA blunt tooth scratches my mindStrong heart races fastBurdened belly sighsAstute tongue spits the venomShame undresses fatGolden eyes drop-downMy inner dragon breathes fireSoul sings sordid laughs\u00a9 Anisesh 2019In response to the haiku/tanka prompt \u201cBreathes\u201d by Deborah ChristensenBody Acceptance (Self-love)21 September 2019 Haiku/Tanka prompt word \u201cbreathes\u201dmedium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Haiku", "House Of Haiku", "Poetry", "Poetry On Medium", "Body Shaming"]}, {"title": "MVC, MVVM, VIPER, Reactive?", "post_link": "https://ronaldolima.eti.br/mvc-mvvm-viper-reactive-7d253208e728?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ronaldo Faria Lima", "author_link": "https://ronaldolima.eti.br/@ronaldolima", "publish_date": "2017-09-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-27", "readtime": "2.78", "claps": 21, "voters": 12, "content": "MVC, MVVM, VIPER, Reactive?Qual arquitetura usar no iOS?Ronaldo Faria LimaFollowSep 21, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readDepois que a programa\u00e7\u00e3o para apps popularizou-se, v\u00e1rias arquiteturas novas surgiram para tentar simplificar as coisas.

Nada disso.

Use a arquitetura que lhe d\u00ea vantagens. Se VIPER entrega mais r\u00e1pido o que voc\u00ea precisa, use-a. Se MVVM tem vantagens sobre a arquitetura MVC para determinado projeto, use-a.

This might be a bit confusing or even appear mystical, technically-infeasible. For some clarity, here\u2019s a mini-story that illustrates the basic principle of zk-SNARKs.Double TroubleOur story begins with a parrot and a viper, who have an affectionate yet mischievous relationship. The two friends are prowling the jungle in search of a tropical treat.Shortly after setting off, they come upon a tree bearing two mangoes. Upon inspection, the viper remarks excitedly that the mangoes are (miraculously) identical! The parrot disagrees and insists that there is indeed a difference.There\u2019s good reason for this dispute: while snakes are color-blind, parrots have superb vision. And so, the parrot, unlike the viper, recognizes a subtle difference in color between the two mangoes. The parrot proposes a game to prove she is right but desires to do so without revealing how the two mangoes are different. The viper reluctantly agrees and the game begins.Each round, the viper hides both mangoes from the parrot and chooses one mango to reveal. The parrot then decides if the revealed mango is the same as in the previous round. After many rounds have passed, the parrot boasts a perfect score; she\u2019s guessed correctly every round.Illustrations by Lea Filipo.With each successive round, it becomes increasingly likely that the two fruit are different. How else could the parrot guess correctly every time? Faced with the parrot\u2019s success, the viper has no choice but to concede that the two mangoes are indeed different. You can think of the parrot as the prover and the viper as the verifier.This \u2014 admittedly strange \u2014 tale illustrates the \u201czero-knowledge\u201d or zk property of zk-SNARKs. During the above interaction, the parrot convinces the viper that a certain statement is true (that the two mangoes are different) without revealing why it\u2019s true (because they are different colors). This framing should look familiar to the definition that we laid out at the beginning of the article.Take the core concept of this story, add a dash of cryptography, toss it in the world of blockchain, and you\u2019ll end up with a rough but palatable approximation of zk-SNARKs.Now that we have a sense of how zk-SNARKs work, let\u2019s have a look at what they can do.Taking the PlungeBefore we talk about how zk-SNARKs could help scale Ethereum by a \u201chuge amount,\u201d there\u2019s another use case that\u2019s worth mentioning: privacy. Crypto projects like Zcash use zk-SNARKs as a way to maintain a publicly-verified ledger while shielding participant identification and keeping transaction data anonymous.How does it work? Think back to the parrot\u2019s game. But instead of mischief and mangoes, think in terms of tokens and transfers. Simply put, someone can prove ownership of a token and send it to someone else without revealing the value of the token or the identity of the recipient. Again, this framing should look familiar to the definition that we laid out at the beginning of the article.ScalabilityPrivacy is undoubtedly cool. But developers soon realized that zk-SNARKs could also alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. zk-SNARKs could be leveraged to generate small and tidy computational proofs \u2014 even if the computation in question was executed off-chain, that is, untethered to the Ethereum network.The process of simply verifying one of these proofs is cheaper and faster than having to execute the computation on the Ethereum network. So, zk-SNARK proofs can be generated off-chain and then verified on-chain. This process basically offloads the computational heavy lifting to off-chain computational resources and thereby frees up far more limited on-chain resources.In other words, this process essentially shrinks the amount of on-chain resources needed for each computation. And if each computation consumes fewer resources, the Ethereum network can process more of them. The end result? Greater scalability.Crucially, zk-SNARKs maintains the security guarantees of on-chain computations. That is, you can still prove that you ran your program or executed a certain smart contract in a trustless manner.Vitalik Buterin preaching the gospel of zkSnarks.As Buterin mentions in this Tweet, a zk-SNARK is considered a \u201clayer 2\u201d solution, which means that it could be implemented without altering the blockchain itself. But, unlike other \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions, such as Plasma or Raiden, zk-SNARKs doesn\u2019t require data to be held off-chain. (For the curious, a \u201clayer 1\u201d solution, like sharding, directly alters the functionality of the base-layer blockchain.)The Road Aheadzk-SNARKs isn\u2019t a silver bullet. It won\u2019t vanquish Ethereum\u2019s scalability limitations overnight. And it still faces a number of technical hurdles. While clever solutions are already in the works (e.g. this one), the true promise of zk-SNARKs is patiently awaiting real-world deployment and implementation.Despite its nascent form, the technology represents a promising route toward a more functional Ethereum network. Vitalik Buterin estimated that zk-SNARKs could bring the Ethereum network throughput from 15 to 500 transactions per second \u2014 an increase of over 30x. While this is surely a tall claim, Buterin isn\u2019t known to be the hyperbolic type. And if he\u2019s right, headlines decrying Ethereum\u2019s inability to process CryptoKitty transactions could be (god-willing) a thing of the past.Other ResourcesFollow Gnosis and me on Twitter.Check out what Gnosis developers are doing with zk-SNARKs on GitHub.Read \u201cGetting Started with zk-SNARKs,\u201d a tutorial about deploying zk-SNARKs from Felix, a developer at Gnosis.Much thanks to Lauren Dunmore, Lea Filipowicz, Nadja Bene\u0161, and Kei Kreutler.Disclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

They inform to Presenter, events generated by the user, and expect his response with the data that must be displayed.The views are responsible for knowing how to display the data and manage the user interactions.They work with data through view models, that contain the specific data that they must display.PresenterThey receive events from the Views, and based on these, they can comun\u00edcate with the Interactors, for to require a data request, or comun\u00edcate with the Routing or Wireframe, for to perform some navigation logic in the application.When the Interactors have answered, the Presenters are responsable to performing a transformation data, between business models (using the Interactors) and view models (using the Views). Once transformed, they communicate with the Views, to inform the view models to display.Presenters don\u2019t know how are compose the Views.InteractorThey are responsible to perform all business logic. They work with business models or Entities.Interactors must handle request data from Presenters. And therefore in turn make calls to services, data bases or search anywhere where data are. They transform data in business models or Entities. Once data is processed, they are given to Presenters.Interactors don\u2019t know about user interface.EntityThey represent own data of business logic of the application and are handled by the Interactors.RoutingThey are responsible for performing all screens navigation, into the application. Routings are also called Wireframes.They are first to be created and are themselves responsible for creating the others components: Views, Presenters, Interactors, establishing the relationships between them.They receive requests of Presenters and are responsables for transmitting data between screens.They allow know what are the different possibilities of navigation within the application.When you should use VIPERWhen we want provide our projects an orderly structure, easily and clearly scalable, also reusable, where you may developing in parallels the different components without conflicts.VIPER facilitates the testing of components, also the posibles bugs that may be generated as each component encapsulates different responsibilities.When you shouldn\u2019t use VIPERVIPER implicate the creation of many components and this can be a inconvenient, if your project is small and you know it won\u2019t be scalable in the future.Also, is necessary that all developers team know VIPER perfectly, to avoid create hybrids with others patterns, that may hinder the development and maintenance of the project.ExampleI leave here a small project developed in Swift as example of project with VIPER pattern. I hope it can help you.https://github.com/aortegas/VIPER_Example.gitPlease, let me know your opinion with this article, your questions or bugs produced. Thanks for your feedback.

B\u011bhem prvn\u00edch p\u00e1r hodin cesty jsme si v\u0161imli, \u017ee n\u011bkte\u0159\u00ed cestuj\u00edc\u00ed odch\u00e1z\u00ed kamsi a u\u017e se nevrac\u00ed.

Nev\u00edme, jestli to doprov\u00e1zela n\u011bjak\u00e1 sleva, ale je mo\u017en\u00e9, \u017ee tento upgrade vyjde levn\u011bji ne\u017e b\u011b\u017en\u00fd l\u00edstek do l\u016f\u017ekov\u00e9 \u010d\u00e1sti.Buddha, kam se pod\u00edv\u00e1\u0161Po ubytov\u00e1n\u00ed v hostelu jsme neomyln\u011b zam\u00ed\u0159ili sm\u011brem k Fei Lai Feng komplexu (bus Y1, Y2, K7 a dal\u0161\u00ed zaj\u00ed\u017ed\u00ed a\u017e t\u00e9m\u011b\u0159 ke vstupu, zast\u00e1vka Lingyin station). Cel\u00fd komplex je pom\u011brn\u011b rozs\u00e1hl\u00fd a schra\u0148uje n\u011bkolik buddhistick\u00fdch chr\u00e1m\u016f a dal\u0161\u00ed objekt\u016f. Na\u0161\u00edm hlavn\u00edm c\u00edlem ale byly sochy Buddh\u016f vytesan\u00e9 do skal a okoln\u00edch jeskyn\u00ed. Mimochodem vstupn\u00e9 fungovalo stejn\u011b jako v\u0161ude v \u010c\u00edn\u011b \u2014 plat\u00ed se jak za hlavn\u00ed vstup, tak za n\u011bkter\u00e9 dal\u0161\u00ed objekty uvnit\u0159.Hned u vstupu se nach\u00e1z\u00ed syst\u00e9m jeskyn\u00ed s des\u00edtkami vytesan\u00fdch so\u0161ek boh\u016f a r\u016fzn\u00fdch postavi\u010dek. My jsme ale st\u00e1le hledali tu hlavn\u00ed so\u0161ku vysm\u00e1t\u00e9ho Buddhy, kter\u00e1 byla vyobrazena i na vstupence. Cel\u00e9 davy se hrnuly sm\u011brem vzh\u016fru na vrchol skal, tak jsme si \u0159ekli, \u017ee se tam asi bude nach\u00e1zet jako odm\u011bna za v\u00fdstup. Po 30 minut\u00e1ch ne \u00fapln\u011b pohodov\u00e9ho v\u00fd\u0161lapu jsme se ocitli na vrcholu, kde nebylo krom\u011b st\u00e1nku s ob\u010derstven\u00edm, kter\u00fd tu p\u016fsobil jako p\u011bst na oko, a jednoho n\u00e1pisu v\u016fbec nic. Nabuzeni t\u00edmto pohledem jsme se vydali zp\u011bt dol\u016f, kdy se v pln\u00e9 par\u00e1d\u011b uk\u00e1zala kvalita Martinin\u00fdch \u017eabek, ve kter\u00fdch j\u00ed sice nebylo vedro, ale po cest\u011b dol\u016f se na bahnit\u00e9m kopci n\u011bkolikr\u00e1t m\u00e1lem p\u0159izabila.Po sestupu jsme popo\u0161li asi 10 metr\u016f pod\u00e9l potoka a byl tam \u2014 hledan\u00fd Buddha. Spolu s mnoha dal\u0161\u00edmi. Kolem skal je voln\u011b p\u0159\u00edstupn\u00e1 cesta, tak\u017ee se na rytiny m\u016f\u017eete pod\u00edvat p\u011bkn\u011b zbl\u00edzka a pot\u00e9 pokra\u010dovat d\u00e1l po libovoln\u00e9 stran\u011b potoka. U skal nav\u00edc vedou dal\u0161\u00ed bo\u010dn\u00ed cesti\u010dky, tak\u017ee to lze cel\u00e9 pojmout jako pr\u016fzkumn\u00fd v\u00fdlet. Nedaleko jsou pak chr\u00e1my (n\u011bkter\u00e9 p\u0159\u00edstupn\u00e9 voln\u011b, n\u011bkter\u00e9 za poplatek).

A kdy\u017e p\u00ed\u0161u nedalek\u00e9ho, mysl\u00edm 20 minut autobusem. Od Buddhy to jsou 2 stanice zp\u011bt do centra, p\u0159estup a pot\u00e9 asi dal\u0161\u00ed 3 stanice busem Y3. Napadlo n\u00e1s (no dob\u0159e, m\u011b), \u017ee bychom mohli doj\u00edt ty 2 stanice p\u011b\u0161ky a jet jen jedn\u00edm autobusem. No a po necel\u00fdch 30 minut\u00e1ch ch\u016fze a 19 minut\u00e1ch j\u00edzdy busem jsme dorazili p\u0159ed muzeum. O nic sv\u011btoborn\u00e9ho se nejedn\u00e1, ale bylo to celkem fajn zpest\u0159en\u00ed.Hned vedle muzea se rozprost\u00edraj\u00ed \u010dajov\u00e9 plant\u00e1\u017ee a p\u00e1r restaurac\u00ed / \u010dajoven. \u0158ekli jsme si, \u017ee kdy\u017e u\u017e jsme tu, tak si \u0161\u00e1lek d\u00e1me. \u00dapln\u011b jsme se asi nepochopili s obsluhou a po kr\u00e1tk\u00e9 roztr\u017ece jsme m\u00edsto 1 konvice a 2 skleni\u010dek dostali jen 2 skleni\u010dky, ka\u017edou nap\u011bchovanou \u010dajem a vodou. V\u00fdsledek si m\u016f\u017eete tipnout, \u010daj byl nechutn\u011b siln\u00fd a ve\u010der n\u00e1m z n\u011bho bylo \u0161patn\u011b. Ale zato to st\u00e1lo ,,jen\u201d 20 jen\u016f.Osv\u011b\u017eeni jsme se vydali zp\u011bt do centra na ve\u010de\u0159i. Po chv\u00edli beznad\u011bje, kdy jsme hledali n\u011bjakou cenov\u011b p\u0159ijatelnou restauraci, jsme narazili na \u201cz\u00e1vodn\u00ed j\u00eddelnu\u201d, kde d\u00e1vali celkem velk\u00fd porce za dobrou cenu. Hlavn\u011b jsme ale vid\u011bli j\u00eddlo p\u0159edem na vlastn\u00ed o\u010di, tak\u017ee jsme snad prvn\u011b v\u011bd\u011bli, co si d\u00e1v\u00e1me.Mas\u00e1\u017eA je to tady, nastal slavostn\u00ed okam\u017eik, o kter\u00e9m si budeme je\u0161t\u011b za 10 let vypr\u00e1v\u011bt. Za\u0161li jsme si s Martinou na \u010d\u00ednskou mas\u00e1\u017e do salonu Bona Caiba. Kdy\u017e jsme vlezli dovnit\u0159, divil jsem se, \u017ee je tam takov\u00e1 fronta a u\u017e jsem cht\u011bl j\u00edt pry\u010d. Pak m\u011b ale Martina upozornila, \u017ee to jsou v\u0161echno mas\u00e9rky a \u017ee tam vlastn\u011b nikdo jin\u00fd nen\u00ed. Rukama nohama jsme se domluvili, kde co a jak dlouho se bude mas\u00edrovat a \u0161lo se na v\u011bc. Ka\u017ed\u00fd jsme byli v jin\u00e9 m\u00edstnosti, tak\u00e9 pr\u016fb\u011bh byl u ka\u017ed\u00e9ho jin\u00fd. U m\u011b to vypadalo takto:Dostal jsem py\u017eamoP\u0159evl\u00edkl jsem seVyfotil jsem si selfieP\u0159i\u0161la mas\u00e9rka, zapnula televiziZa\u010dala mas\u00e1\u017eMas\u00e9rka se ob\u010das lehce uchechtla p\u0159i poslechu n\u011bjak\u00e9 humorn\u00e9 \u010d\u00ednsk\u00e9 sc\u00e9nyPo hodince mas\u00e1\u017e kon\u010d\u00edMartina py\u017eamo nedostala, za to na ni ale mas\u00e9rka vyt\u00e1hla gumov\u00e9 klad\u00edvko a za\u010dala j\u00ed naklep\u00e1vat kotn\u00edky.Po skon\u010den\u00ed jsme pod\u011bkovali \u201cTsi-e Tsi-e\u201d a rozlou\u010dili se \u201cBye Bye\u201d, co\u017e je z n\u011bjak\u00e9ho d\u016fvodu v\u0161echny rozesm\u00e1lo, a \u0161li jsme putovat d\u00e1le. S Martinou jsme se shodli, \u017ee mas\u00e1\u017e pat\u0159ila k t\u011bm lehce nadpr\u016fm\u011brn\u00fdm, m\u011b to akor\u00e1t lehce bolelo.Cel\u00ed nabuzen\u00ed po mas\u00e1\u017ei jsme si dal\u0161\u00ed den cht\u011bli p\u016fj\u010dit kola a projet se kolem jezera. Bohu\u017eel jsme jednak nena\u0161li \u017e\u00e1dnou p\u016fj\u010dovnu kol, nav\u00edc za\u010dalo i pr\u0161et. B\u011b\u017eeli jsme schovat pod st\u0159\u00ed\u0161ku pagodov\u00e9ho alt\u00e1nu, kde jsme sledovali m\u00edstn\u00edho kresl\u00ed\u0159e, jak zpodobil portr\u00e9t mal\u00e9 hol\u010di\u010dky. Docela mu to \u0161lo, py\u0161n\u00fd t\u00e1ta si od n\u011bho nakonec portr\u00e9t koupil. Pot\u00e9 u\u017e mal\u00ed\u0159e nikdo jin\u00fd neoslovil, tak on naopak oslovil Martinu, \u017ee chce nakreslit jej\u00ed evropsk\u00fd profil. Je vtipn\u00fd, \u017ee na v\u00fdsledn\u00e9m obr\u00e1zku m\u00e1 siln\u011b asijsk\u00e9 rysy, portr\u00e9ty ne-\u010c\u00ed\u0148an\u016f asi moc netr\u00e9nuje. Ka\u017edop\u00e1dn\u011b na konci se s Martinou a sv\u00fdm d\u00edlem vyfotil a malbu j\u00ed nechal.Posledn\u00ed, co jsme v Hangzhou nav\u0161t\u00edvili, byl b\u00fdval\u00fd d\u016fm obchodn\u00edka Xueyan Hu. Je to docela velk\u00e1 a fotogenick\u00e1 stavba se spoustou cesti\u010dek a podzemn\u00edch schovek, j\u00e1 se tam docela vyblbnul.Cesta zp\u011bt do Hong KonguA u\u017e se pomalu bl\u00ed\u017e\u00edme do fin\u00e1le! Z Hangzhou jsme m\u011bli zp\u011bt do Shenzhenu l\u00edstky \u201cHard Seat\u201d, tedy ten nejnepohodln\u011bj\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob cestov\u00e1n\u00ed, kter\u00fd lze po\u0159\u00eddit (pokud nepo\u010d\u00edt\u00e1me j\u00edzdu na osl\u00edku nebo v no\u010dn\u00edm buse). Trochu n\u00e1m nedocvaklo, \u017ee odjezd v 21:00 je u\u017e celkem pozdn\u00ed a \u017ee v\u00fddej l\u00edstk\u016f u\u017e m\u016f\u017ee b\u00fdt uzav\u0159en\u00fd. Co\u017e samoz\u0159ejm\u011b byl. P\u0159i pohledu na v\u00fddejn\u00ed automaty jsme tak leda dostali chu\u0165 na \u010daj, napadlo n\u00e1s ale, \u017ee by na n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed mohlo b\u00fdt je\u0161t\u011b dal\u0161\u00ed v\u00fddejn\u00ed ok\u00e9nko. Po chvilce b\u011bh\u00e1n\u00ed jsme ho na\u0161li, samoz\u0159ejm\u011b bylo tak\u00e9 zav\u0159en\u00e9. To u\u017e jsme za\u010dali trochu panika\u0159it a po\u010d\u00edtat, kolik by st\u00e1lo vz\u00edt si taxi. Po n\u011bkolika nul\u00e1ch jsme toho nechali a zoufale se za\u010dali pt\u00e1t lid\u00ed na potk\u00e1n\u00ed, co m\u00e1me d\u011blat. Person\u00e1l n\u011bkam m\u00e1vnul rukou a cosi za\u017evatlal, tak jsme tam rychle p\u0159ib\u011bhli a\u2026 na\u0161li jsme otev\u0159en\u00e9 v\u00fddejn\u00ed ok\u00e9nko. Heur\u00e9ka!L\u00edstky jsme tedy nakonec dostali, zpocen\u00e9 pono\u017eky jsme si vym\u011bnili. Dokonce jsme ve front\u011b potkali 2 \u010ce\u0161ky, jedna se n\u00e1s n\u011bco anglicky zeptala, my j\u00ed \u010desky odpov\u011bd\u011bli. To n\u011bjak vyignorovala a zeptala se n\u00e1s znovu anglicky. To m\u011b docela zm\u00e1tlo a za\u010dal jsem p\u0159em\u00fd\u0161let nad t\u00edm, jestli jsme j\u00ed skute\u010dn\u011b odpov\u011bd\u011bli \u010desky. Martina se ale zm\u00e1st nenechala, tak\u017ee jsme si nakonec i trochu pokecali. Holky ale sp\u011bchaly na vlak do \u0160angaje, tak hned utekly.Po nalod\u011bn\u00ed jsme za\u010dali Hard Seatu trochu litovat. Seda\u010dky jsou sice celkem velik\u00e9, ale nemaj\u00ed \u017e\u00e1dn\u00e1 op\u011br\u00e1tka ani na hlavu, ani na ruce. No\u010dn\u00ed cesta tak byla docela peklo a pr\u016fvod\u010d\u00ed, kter\u00fd ka\u017edou hodinu vy\u0159v\u00e1val, jestli n\u011bkdo nechce nudle, byl Lucifer.Hong Kong podruh\u00e9Po p\u0159ekon\u00e1n\u00ed hrani\u010dn\u00edho p\u0159echodu Futian/Lok Ma Chau jsme se ihned vydali na ostrov Lantau (metrem na Tung Chung Station), odkud se d\u00e1 dostat k nad\u017eivotn\u00edmu Buddhovi. Martina neust\u00e1le posp\u00edchala, skoro a\u017e sprintovala k \u00falo\u017en\u00fdm sk\u0159\u00ed\u0148k\u00e1m v m\u00edstn\u00edm obchodn\u00edm centru, kam jsme se cht\u011bli d\u00e1t batohy. Z toho jsem byl docela otr\u00e1venej (Martina zas byl otr\u00e1ven\u00e1 z toho, jak jsem byl otr\u00e1venej), kdy\u017e jsme tam ale p\u0159il\u00edtli, u\u017e jich tam na n\u00e1s moc nezb\u00fdvalo, nav\u00edc hned za n\u00e1mi p\u0159ib\u011bhli dal\u0161\u00ed turisti.Po odhozen\u00ed batoh\u016f jsme se hned vydali na bus \u010d. 23, kter\u00fd jezd\u00ed a\u017e k Buddhovi. Cena m\u011bla pro oba b\u00fdt 19 HKD, nakonec jsme ale platili 58 (v\u010detn\u011b v\u00edkendov\u00e9ho p\u0159\u00edplatku). Plat\u00ed se samoz\u0159ejm\u011b cash a v\u00fdb\u011br\u010d\u00ed nevrac\u00ed, tak jsme si za\u0161li je\u0161t\u011b do Starbucksu rozm\u011bnit. Kdy\u017e jsme se vr\u00e1tili, m\u011bli jsme probl\u00e9m n\u00e1stupn\u00ed zast\u00e1vku naj\u00edt, stihla se tam toti\u017e vytvo\u0159it asi 200m fronta. Ze zoufalstv\u00ed jsme se za\u0161li pod\u00edvat i kolik stoj\u00ed lanovka, kde byla fronta jen 198 m. U\u017e nev\u00edm kolik to bylo, ale vzpom\u00edn\u00e1m si, \u017ee bylo levn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed si koupit scooter a dojet tam na n\u011bm. Rezignovan\u011b jsme tedy vyst\u00e1li frontu na bus.Naho\u0159e jsme nechali Buddhu Buddhou a \u0161li jsme se nejd\u0159\u00edv naj\u00edst do m\u00edstn\u00ed vegetari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 restaurace, kter\u00e1 je sou\u010d\u00e1st\u00ed Po Lin Monastery. Jednalo se o docela drahou masovku pro turisty, ale nic jin\u00e9ho jsme v okol\u00ed nena\u0161li. Pot\u00e9, co se Martina najedla (a j\u00e1 jen smutn\u011b koukal na v\u0161echnu tu zeleninu), jsme se plni energie kone\u010dn\u011b vydali na v\u00fd\u0161lap k Buddhovi. V tom vedru a tla\u010dence s ostatn\u00edmi to byl celkem z\u00e1\u017eitek, v\u00fdstup je to ale hodn\u011b kr\u00e1tk\u00fd, tak\u017ee jsme kupodivu propotili jen 1 tri\u010dko. P\u0159\u00edmo uvnit\u0159 ob\u0159\u00ed sochy je i nezaj\u00edmav\u00e9 muzeum, zaj\u00edmav\u00e9 jsou jen okoln\u00ed sochy a samoz\u0159ejm\u011b v\u00fdhled.S Buddhou jsme se rozlou\u010dili a vydali se u\u017e sm\u011brem na leti\u0161t\u011b, kter\u00e9 je hned na vedlej\u0161\u00edm ostrov\u011b a jezd\u00ed tam levn\u00fd bus S1. Odlet prob\u011bhl bez probl\u00e9m\u016f, ve \u0160v\u00fdcarsku jsme m\u011bli 6 hodinov\u00fd p\u0159estup, tak jsme se tam alespo\u0148 vysprchovali (sprchy maj\u00ed minim\u00e1ln\u011b 3) a dali si Lindt horkou \u010dokol\u00e1du. P\u016fvodn\u011b jsme se cht\u011bli je\u0161t\u011b pod\u00edvat do centra Curychu, u\u017e jsme ale byli tak unaven\u00ed, \u017ee jsme se jen vykempili na leti\u0161ti.A to je v\u0161eA to je v\u0161e, p\u0159\u00e1tel\u00e9. Takhle jsme poznali malou \u010d\u00e1st \u010c\u00ednsk\u00e9 Lidov\u00e9 Republiky. Spoustu jsme toho nestihli, ale ani jsme ne\u010dekali, \u017ee b\u011bhem jedn\u00e9 cesty pozn\u00e1me celou \u010c\u00ednu.

However with many people sharing the same service, I found them slow, unreliable and would often take forever to connect.In this article I\u2019ll explain how I managed to setup my own personal VPN for free! You too should be able to set it up in the time it takes me to watch this 10 minute YouTube cat video (in HD on my personal VPN, thank you).To get the free VPN I\u2019m making use of a promotion through Alibaba Cloud. But before you start there are 3 things you\u2019ll need:A non-Chinese phone number (to get a text sent through to register)A non-Chinese card (or a Paypal account should also be fine)Be willing to get your hands dirty on the technical side (but I\u2019ll do my best to walk you through it!)It\u2019ll all be worth it when you\u2019re streaming cat videos in HD \u2014 let\u2019s start!Step 1 \u2014 registerGo to AlibabaCloud.com and follow the instructions to sign up for a free account. After you\u2019ve verified a payment method you\u2019ll get $300 free credit which we\u2019ll use to setup the VPN.Step 2 \u2014 setup an Elastic Compute ServiceElastic Compute Service? Ignore the jargon, it basically means you\u2019ll get your own computer living in a big rack of lots of other computers somewhere, that is all yours. We\u2019ll be controlling it remotely from your own computer.Go to the Alibaba Cloud Free Credit page and under \u201cElastic Computer Service\u201d click \u201cTry it now\u201d. This takes you to a page to configure it.60 days and 530 GB, all free!Most of this we don\u2019t need to change and you can ignore, apart from the following:Under \u201cChoose the Datacenter Region and Zone\u201d, we can choose where our VPN is going to be. It\u2019s up to you \u2014 I chose Hong Kong as it\u2019s close to Mainland China but its internet is unrestricted. Note generally the closer the place the faster the speeds you\u2019ll get.In \u201cChoose Network Type\u201d, under \u201cNetwork Type\u201d just click the dropdown and choose the defaults here.Just below that is \u201cSecurity Group\u201d. This is slightly more involved \u2014 we\u2019re going to open a port just for our VPN to use.- Click \u201cSelect security group\u201d- Click \u201cShow group rules\u201d which will take you to a new page- On this page click the button \u201cAdd Security Group Rules\u201d at the top- Leave most settings as they are. But under \u201cPort Range\u201d type \u201c8000/8000\u201d and under \u201cAuthorization Object\u201d type \u201c0.0.0.0/0\u201d.- Click \u201cOK\u201d and you can close this page!- On our previous page we can just choose the group we just modified. Basically click on the one with the name that looks like your cat just walked all over your keyboard.Under \u201cSecurity Setting\u201d select \u201cSet Password\u201d and, well, set a password. Don\u2019t forget it! \u2014 we\u2019ll need this so you and only you can log into your remote computer you\u2019re setting up.Click \u201cBuy Now\u201d. You\u2019ll be taken to the confirmation page. At the bottom you should see the beautiful \u201cPrice\uff1a $ 0.00 USD\u201d \u2014 if you don\u2019t, it means you haven\u2019t activated your free credit. Note it\u2019s free for now, but when the credit runs out in 60 days you\u2019ll start being charged, so make sure you check up on that. Go ahead and complete your order!It\u2019s beautifulStep 3 \u2014 log in to our remote computerThis is the cool part, where we\u2019ll control our remote computer right from where you are. Go to your ECS Console after logging in, click on \u201cInstances 1\u201d and you\u2019ll see the computer you setup just now in Step 2. Under \u201cStatus\u201d it\u2019ll probably still be starting up. Wait a few minutes and refresh until the Status has a green light and says \u201cRunning\u201d.To the left of that you\u2019ll see the IP address column, with a \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d and \u201cPrivate IP Address\u201d. The first is our public address so we can find our computer on the internet, the second is internal only and we\u2019ll need them both later for our VPN, so make a note of them.If you\u2019re on Windows you need to download a program called PuTTY, you can download it here. But if you\u2019re on Mac it\u2019s much easier, just open a program called \u201cTerminal\u201d you already have. If you\u2019ve haven\u2019t used these before don\u2019t fear \u2014 I\u2019ll list a bunch of commands you need to run below, all you need to do is copy and paste them in, and press Enter to run them.Mac Users \u2014 TerminalWe\u2019ll start with one import command. First type the below line but you need to replace \u201cyour_ip\u201d with the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d you saw just now. E.g. if my column said \u201c20.20.20.20 (Internet IP Address)\u201d you need to type ssh root@20.20.20.20ssh root@your_ipNow type the password you set earlier and press Enter.Windows Users \u2014 PuTTYOpen PuTTY, enter the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d you saw just now under \u201cHost Name\u201d, make sure \u201cConnection type\u201d is SSH, and click \u201cOpen\u201d. It will say \u201clogin as\u201d, enter root, and then enter the password you set earlier.And we\u2019re in! This is SSH, you are now logged into and controlling another computer hundreds of miles away while you\u2019re lying in bed with your cat \u2014 cool huh?Step 4 \u2014 set up a Shadowsocks serverA what server you may be thinking? This is a server specifically designed to get around the Chinese firewall so we can continue to watch cat videos on YouTube smoothly. The standard VPN services like ExpressVPN are basically setting up a server which lots of people are sharing. You\u2019re going to set up a private server, just for you!Type these commands and press Enter like before (but they\u2019re now being run on our remote computer), I\u2019ll briefly explain what\u2019s going on as we proceed:Install shadowsockspip install shadowsocks2. Download a library for encrypting our internet traffic which shadowsocks requireswget https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.10/libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz3. Unzip ittar xf libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz && cd libsodium-1.0.104. Install it./configure && make && make install5. Setup a config fileecho /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr_local_lib.conf6. Make sure we can use our new library by linking itldconfig7. Create a config file for our servervim /etc/shadowsocks.jsonWhoa, what happened here? We\u2019re using vim, a very powerful text editor. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, I\u2019ll walk you through what you need to know.We\u2019re going to copy and paste the below text, but like before you need to replace your_private_IP_address with the \u201cPrivate IP Address\u201d you noted down earlier. And replace your_password with a password that you can use to login to your VPN. Keep in mind you may want to share your VPN with others later on, so probably best to not make it the same as your Facebook password, in case your cat tries to hack in (again).{    \"server\":\"your_private_IP_address\",    \"server_port\":8000,    \"local_port\":1080,    \"password\":\"your_password\",    \"timeout\":600,    \"method\":\"chacha20\"}So to do this in vim, first press \u201ca\u201d on your keyboard. Now paste (\u2318/Ctrl + V) the above with your values. Press \u201cesc\u201d on your keyboard to finish, and then type :wq to save and quit the file.8. Start our server if the remote computer restartsWe\u2019re about to start our VPN server, but we don\u2019t want to keep having to come back and set it up again if our remote computer restarts at some point in the future, right? To avoid this, type the commandvim /etc/rc.localWe\u2019re back in vim. Press \u201ca\u201d again to edit the file, scroll down with your mouse or arrow keys (you can\u2019t click with your mouse), and at the end copy and paste this into its own line:/usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d startNow press \u201cesc\u201d and type :wq like before to save and quit.You\u2019re doing great, just one command to go!8. Run your shadowsocks serverssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d startBoom. That\u2019s it, if you don\u2019t see any errors your own personal VPN is set up and running, all for you. Feel free to close PuTTY / Terminal, now we actually need to use it\u2026Step 5 \u2014 download ShadowsocksNow we need to install a free program on your computer to connect to the server you just set up. Go to the Shadowsocks Download page and install the \u201cGUI Client\u201d for your system. Just download the \u201c.zip\u201d file it shows.Note that the download page has some mobile apps for accessing your VPN on your phone too! But I\u2019d recommend testing it works on your computer first.Open Shadowsocks and go to \u201cServers\u201d > \u201cServer Preferences\u201d. Under address, type the public IP (the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d) you noted down earlier, and after the colon enter \u201c8000\u201d. For encryption we want \u201cchacha20\u201d and enter the password you just pasted into that file in Step 4. Under \u201cRemarks\u201d choose a name (e.g. \u201cSuper Awesome VPN\u201d) and click \u201cOK\u201d. Make sure Shadowsocks is enabled, and now try opening Google.com!I never thought seeing Google could be so beautifulShadowsocks is amazing because when you open a website, it will by default not use your VPN. So for example in China, if you go to Baidu.com it\u2019s not going to use your VPN and so be really fast. But Shadowsocks stores a list of websites that are blocked in China (e.g. Google and Facebook) and will use the VPN automatically for those. Magic!This setting is called \u201cProxy Auto Configure Mode\u201d. You\u2019ll see it has a tick next to it in the Shadowsocks menu. If you instead choose \u201cGlobal Mode\u201d, all websites will load through your VPN. But Chinese sites / apps (like WeChat) will probably be much slower.Congratulations on setting up your personal VPN!Now you have a VPN server setup, anyone else can access it if you let them. Just get someone you want to share access to it to follow Step 5 and provide them with the password you set. If there\u2019s only a few of you using it at the same time, it should still be quite fast, and you can split the cost together.Also don\u2019t forget your free credit will run out in a couple of months and start charging you, but it\u2019s definitely worth paying later on anyway! And keep an eye on how many cat videos you\u2019re streaming, the free credit allows 530GB data download per month, and will probably charge you a little bit if you go over that.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["VPN", "China", "Shadowsocks", "Alibabacloud"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://dagblog.cz/h%C3%A1danka-o-t%C5%99ech-vyp%C3%ADna%C4%8D%C3%ADch-804b17fbd474?source=search_post", "author_name": "Roman Pichl\u00edk", "author_link": "https://dagblog.cz/@dagi", "publish_date": "2004-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-02", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Roman Pichl\u00edkFollowSep 9, 2004 \u00b7 1 min readH\u00e1danka o t\u0159ech vyp\u00edna\u010d\u00edchMam tu dal\u0161\u00ed velice p\u011bkn\u011b vype\u010denou h\u00e1danku.M\u00e1me m\u00edstnost, uvnit\u0159 m\u00edstnosti je \u017e\u00e1rovka.

Posedl nas totiz demon, ktery na nas dosedl na dabelskych vodopadech.Trznice byla provonena smesi vsech moznych esenci. Snoubila se zde vune koriandru, kurkumy, papajy, pitahayi (draci ovoce \u2013 bila duzina s cernymi pecickami), quanabany, prepaleneho tuku i jakztakz zanovnich kurat.Nejdrive jsme si dali empanadu \u2013 kapsicku z testa smazenou v oleji plnenou syrem. Stala puldolaru a bylo to nakonec ta nejlepsi pochutina.Pak jsme si objednali snidani a k ni kaficko s mlekem. Prakticky to znamenalo, ze pani prinesla salek horkeho mleka a pikslu s vicemene granulovym instantnim kafem. Ti, kteri chteli cerne kafe, dostali horkou vodu a granule. To je typicka ekvadorska kava, pekne prosim. Ke snidani se serviruje casto tigrillos, coz je kockovita selma u nas znama jako ocelot. Pojmenovani je vsak soudim pouze metonymicke, pokrm obsahuje vajicka (michana, na mekko ci omeleta), kus (nastrouhaneho) tvarohoveho syra a nesmi chybet platanos (smazeny banan). Snidani jsme zavrsili ovocnou misou tvorenou papajou, mangem a bananem, tentokrate nesmazenym. V bohatsich ctvrtich se zaliva jogurtem, konzistenci pripominajici spis mleko.Nasledne jsme se pustili do polevek. V tech masovych, zpravidla plavalo dostatek vselijakych trubicek, aort, a ruznych kloubiku, ktere umoznuji zviratkum zit a pohybovat se. Polevce v hustsim provedeni se rika consome. Zeleninova polivka byla prosycena koriandrem. To je koreni, na ktere je treba si zvyknout, jen nekomu to zvykani trva cely zivot.Jako hlavni chod se nam pokusili servirovat seco de carne (maso na sucho), doplnene popularni ryzi, obligatnim obalovanym bananem ci bilou varenou kukurici. Uprednostnil jsem ale pojo asado (kure grilovane), zakusoval jej pojo apenado (kure ve strouhance) a jako prilohu zvolil seco de pojo, k nemuz paradoxne davaji i fazole ci cocku. Vicemene se da pozrit cokoliv, kdyz to pokropite ostre pikantne kyselou salsou, zvanou ach\u00ed, a prokladate to privezenou slivovici.Pak jsme se z trznice posunuli a dali si na spraveni chuti za nekrestanske penize nejake plody mori. Na taliri jsme meli nasekane vse, co se kdy v mori objevilo \u2013 kraba s klepytkem, langustu, krevety s ocickama, namornikem vyflusnute zvykacky zvane kalamary, to vse zalite v zeleninovo kokosove omacce. S bananem samozrejme.Zato rybicka na kurkume servirovana na bananovem listu chutnala vyborne.Citil jsem se jiz docela syt, ale neodolal jsem dezertu. Churro \u2013 sladke tycinky s karamelem a cokoladou se ukazaly byt jako skvela volba.Dostal jsem znovu chut k jidlu. Ochutnal jsem kukuricnou placku, ktera se nicim nevyznacovala, nebyt toho, ze jsem zapomnel jeji nazev. Zrak mi v zapeti utkvel na Salchi papas, pareckach s hranolkami, skoro jako z invencni rakouske kuchyne.Bylo na case zjistit, jak ekvadorci zvladaji i dalsi evropska jidla. Dal jsem si tedy neapolske spageti, pizzu (s kukurici a bohuzel s barbeque majdou), livance i hamburger a obstaly slusne. Nejchutnejsi byla v podani ekvadorcu ale mexicka kuchyne \u2013 burrito plnene fazolovo masovou smesi, guacamole, kus avokada, stejne jako lahodna syrova quesadilla. Celkove eqvadorci vari lepe podle cizich receptu.Jidlo se musi zapit. Mistni pivo zvane Pilsener (proc asi?) chutnalo dobre, snad i lepe nez to drazsi Club. Lemonada dostala svemu nazvu a byla skutecne z citronu, doslazena cukrovou trtinou, vlastnorucne vyrobena. Z netradicnich jugos (dzusu) mi chutnal nejvice guanabana (neco mezi bananovou a snad kokosovou chuti).Na zaver jsme si dali jakesi maso v hnede omacce s ryzi. Chutnalo jako kralik ci teleci. Bylo zrejme, ze se jedna o zdejsi narodni lidove jidlo \u2013 morce. Me mile to prosim neprozrazujte. Pro ni to byla rybicka s hnedym sladkym masem bez kosticek\u2026ps: Upozornuju, ze nejsem gastronom a jiste jsem se nevyhl terminologickym nepresnostem.

Un rapport publi\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 par Futuresource Consulting a mis le nombre d\u2019abonn\u00e9s Netflix fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 environ 750.000, y compris ceux qui profitent d\u2019un essai gratuit d\u2019un mois. Le PDG de Netflix, Reed Hastings, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux m\u00e9dias locaux l\u2019an dernier que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 visait \u00e0 obtenir un tiers du march\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais \u2014 qui totalisent environ 16 millions \u2014 \u00e0 souscrire au service dans les 5 \u00e0 10 premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, avec 10% du march\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le basculement Rentabilit\u00e9.Netflix France offre quelque 11 000 programmes, dont environ 80% sont des s\u00e9ries t\u00e9l\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaines. Il existe une s\u00e9lection restreinte de longs m\u00e9trages \u2014 dont tr\u00e8s peu sont d\u2019origine fran\u00e7aise. En fait, il est plus facile de regarder un film fran\u00e7ais sur le service britannique qu\u2019en France. Il est difficile de savoir si le manque a gagner est d\u00fb au fait que les d\u00e9tenteurs de droits de films fran\u00e7ais refusent de faire affaire avec Netflix ou si Netflix ne poursuit pas le contenu de long m\u00e9trage pour le service fran\u00e7ais en raison de la chronologie fran\u00e7aise stipulant une fen\u00eatre de 36 mois Entre la sortie en salles et la disponibilit\u00e9 sur Internet. La s\u00e9lection des films pour enfants est cependant forte et, apr\u00e8s les \u00e9missions t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9es de premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9, appara\u00eet comme l\u2019un des principaux atouts des abonn\u00e9s fran\u00e7ais au service.En regardant les perspectives \u00e0 plus long terme de Netflix en France, un certain nombre d\u2019agences de recherche pr\u00e9disent que l\u2019entreprise finira par prendre la t\u00eate en termes d\u2019abonn\u00e9s.

L\u2019un des meilleurs services VPN que vous pouvez faire confiance d\u2019apr\u00e8s notre avis est IPVanish.Comment IPVanish fonctionne-t-il?Une fois qu\u2019IPVanish est install\u00e9, il \u00e9tablit une connexion s\u00e9curis\u00e9e entre votre ISP local et le serveur IPVanish. Toutes les donn\u00e9es et informations transmises sont chiffr\u00e9es, ce qui est une fa\u00e7on fantaisiste de dire que personne ne peut le lire.Tout logiciel de surveillance ou outil de collecte de donn\u00e9es ne sera pas en mesure de lire votre trafic gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes de cryptage avanc\u00e9es. En outre, votre adresse IP est masqu\u00e9e compl\u00e8tement de sorte que votre identit\u00e9 personnelle et l\u2019emplacement sont cach\u00e9s de la vue.IPVanish est incroyablement simple et facile \u00e0 utiliser, en fait c\u2019est l\u2019un de ses principaux avantages. Une fois install\u00e9, il n\u2019y a aucun param\u00e8tre suppl\u00e9mentaire pour ajuster ni il ya des cerceaux pour sauter \u00e0 travers. Vous pouvez litt\u00e9ralement d\u00e9marrer IPVanish, se connecter \u00e0 un serveur VPN distant et naviguer loin.Quel genre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 offre IPVanish?Le protocole OpenVPN offre un support de cryptage AES 256 bits, incroyablement s\u00e9curis\u00e9. Votre fournisseur de services Internet ne sera pas en mesure de surveiller ce que vous faites lorsque connect\u00e9 via un VPN. Mieux encore, les journaux de connexion temporaires sont supprim\u00e9s toutes les deux semaines, ce qui signifie que m\u00eame avec une ordonnance de la cour un tiers ne serait pas en mesure de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des journaux de connexion d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. En outre, toutes les adresses IP sont partag\u00e9es entre une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019utilisateurs ce qui signifie m\u00eame avec un journal de connexion, il serait difficile de d\u00e9terminer exactement ce qu\u2019un utilisateur faisait pendant la navigation.Ce dernier point est particuli\u00e8rement important car vous allez probablement utiliser un VPN pour naviguer anonymement et vous voulez qu\u2019il reste de cette fa\u00e7on. Il est inutile d\u2019utiliser un VPN si quelqu\u2019un peut r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les journaux de votre utilisation et surveiller exactement ce que vous faisiez, car il d\u00e9faites l\u2019objectif.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Test Vpn", "Vyprvpn", "Avis Vyprvpn"]}, {"title": "Ekv\u00e1dor \u2014 den 27", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ekv%C3%A1dor-v%C3%BDprava-za-pivem/ekv%C3%A1dor-den-27-e04604b629d8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zden\u00e1l F.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zdendaf", "publish_date": "2019-04-07", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-07", "readtime": "2.14", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Ekv\u00e1dor \u2014 den 27\u010ctvrtek 14. \u00fanora \u2014 Ol\u00f3nZden\u00e1l F.FollowApr 7 \u00b7 3 min readV\u010dera ve\u010der jsme se pokou\u0161eli prodlou\u017eit si pokoj na dal\u0161\u00ed t\u0159i noci.

Upon arrival (damage free), I was able to put it together in a little under three hours, with help from my 14-yr-old son.Being a heavy table, I took precautions to ensure safe handling. The design is seemingly larger, giving you more room to send the pluck flying! For a true arcade feeling, the table came equipped with magnificent lighting and built-in sound.Powered by 110 cubic feet per minute motor, your pluck glides smoothly across the table as the electronic scoreboard keeps track of the progress.Feature of the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game TableThe following are the features that you should know:>>> Click Here to See More Photos Now on Amazon! <<<AestheticsAt 222.7 pounds, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table has a large cabinet supported by big legs. This design ensures its longevity, stability, and durability. Besides evoking a manly appeal, the size and heavyset design will fit perfectly in your man cave too.For a more arcade feel, turning off the table\u2019s lights lets you fully enjoy Arctic Ice aesthetics. By highlighting the LED lights and allowing them to stand out, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re right at the center of the action in an ultra-modern hockey arcade!As a visually appealing table, Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot is designed to capture your attention while still giving you a tough challenge. Though the latest features built into it make it appear a bit chunky, it is among the easiest hockey tables to work with.Smoothly Styled Playing SurfaceTo help with the even flow, this Viper Arctic hockey table has an ultra-smooth, ultra-sleek playing surface. With the high-speed white playing surface offering me continuous play, the pace never seemed to slow down. If you reminisce of the old arcade style, you\u2019ll love the top of this air hockey table. The attractive and sleek look has a retro feel hint, making it fit across all ages. You can now enjoy action-packed arcade fun with high-speed play.For each game action, the light along the table\u2019s rail light up in different patterns and colors, making the game all-the-more interactive.Perfect AirflowTo make sure your games are fair and engaging, Arctic Ice 7-Foot provides enough air flow on its surface. As one of the most important components of a good air hockey table, incredible airflow keeps the game seamless and fluid.The powerful blower effortlessly guides your pucks across the surface, making the table remarkably interactive. With the player dictating the speed and intensity of airflow, the game can get as exciting as you wish!All the while, the game kept up with all my movements; one can play for hours on end without the slightest hint of boredom creeping in. Some tables have poof airflow, sucking the fun right off the game; Viper Arctic Ice is designed to deliver maximum user satisfaction.Arcade Style FeaturesViper Arctic Ice style is simply lovable! At a first glance, it looks and feels like a high-end arcade (which it is). This feel is brought right to your home, complementing whichever environment you place the table in. With the air hockey table at home, I no longer have to spend quarters just to have a good time with my family and friends. This table uses the latest Lumen-X technology in its lighting, masking your every move in a beautiful combination of colors.I particularly liked the fast playing in-game music; it kept me focused and excited enough in every action-packed game. Just like true arcade-style tables, you will hardly mess up your turn with this one.DurabilityAs a heavy-built table, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot requires two adults to move, and extreme care when assembling. While moving may seem like a disadvantage, it instead offers you a huge benefit. At 222.7 pounds, the table won\u2019t rock even during the most aggressive sessions.Being stable and sturdy, this table can withstand a fair amount of wear and tear. Playing air hockey requires a lot of leaning especially when out to score goals; a light and loosely built table would start coming apart pretty soon.To further add to its durability, this stable has large, sturdy legs, distributing its weight evenly while keeping it balanced. This stability gives me room to play better with minimal distractions.Scoring SystemAs a gamer, you acknowledge that each highly competitive game requires a sharp scorekeeper. The Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table comes with a fully electronic scoring system, keeping an accurate record of all player actions.Through it, you can view the score without taking your eyes off the game. Manually changing scores would not only waste your time but also distract you from the task at hand. The table sets the record straight, avoiding minor \u2018disputes\u2019 over the score.Every time a player scores a point, the clearly marked, easy to read numbers update. At the end, all players are satisfied of the accurate tally. With no guess work involved, there\u2019s no limit to how much fun you can have!Spacious and Wide TableMeasuring 84\" by 48\", Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot is spacious enough and didn\u2019t take up too much of my gaming room. Its composition and huge, sturdy legs balance it out automatically, making your play as comfortable as possible.The sharp and nice retro shape makes the table uniquely attractive, adding to incredible game play.Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table \u2014 VideoSmooth surface.Excellent size.Lumen-X Technology.Retro-arcade gaming style setup.Gaming accessories included in the package.Perfect air flow amount.Quite pricey, but worth every pennyLED ScorerRinkDual End Puck ReturnsPlay PackageDimensions: 84\" L x 48\" W x 32\" HWeight: 211 poundsShipping Weight: 222.7 poundsModel number: 64\u20133006Frequently Asked QuestionsA: No; the electronic scoreboard has been screwed on the table top. If you haven\u2019t screwed the scoreboard on though, it is possible.A: Yes; if you wish to, you can turn off the lights to be \u2018only noticeable\u2019 at night. Generic pushers and pucks will work the same.A: 30% of the gaming table can be moved piece by piece. The bulkiest piece, the table top, comes pre-assembled and has to remain intact. By covering it with its box, one can carefully slide it down.Final VerdictIf you are shopping for a long-lasting table which will withstand constant use, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey will be a perfect fit. In terms of gameplay and aesthetics, this air hockey game table stands out from its peers.Offering you and your family an escape from smartphones, tablets, and all other electronic devices, this table offers you a way to spend quality time with your family and friends. It\u2019s not just fun playing, it\u2019s fun watching too!The pushers are rechargeable via micro USB. With button cell batteries, pucks can stay lighted for up to 6 hours.

The following is from 2016. My Husband Alex had written a post sharing where he was at and going through on his journey. A brother decided to come onto his time line and start judging him for where he is and what he is experiencing. I found myself responding to them and the following was the outcome.My response, \u201cIt amazes me how the judgmental come out of the woodwork. The closed minded littleness of folks like, Marianna. If and when an item causes conflict or \u201cnegative\u201d thoughts and emotions within us, we are the ones with the problem. We are the ones \u201cJUDGING\u201d what it is we are viewing and experiencing. Our personal beliefs are what is causing us that pain and suffering.Alex is being completely authentic in sharing where he is at on his journey. He hides nothing because there is nothing to hide. There is nothing for him to be ashamed of, guilty of, or in fear of. He is not and has not done anything wrong EVER!

Go and do your own forgiveness lessons. And you will be both reported to online harassment. Enough said\u201dMy response, \u201cAll that pain and anguish you are experiencing in this moment is being created by you. No one is doing anything to you right now.

In this article, we will be optimizing a neural network and performing hyperparameter tuning in order to obtain a high-performing model on the Beale function \u2014 one of many test functions commonly used for studying the effectiveness of various optimization techniques. This analysis can be reused for any function, but I recommend trying this out yourself on another common test function to test your skills. Personally, I find that optimizing a neural network can be incredibly frustrating (although not as bad as a GAN, if you\u2019re familiar with those..) unless you have a clear and well-defined procedure to follow. I hope you enjoy this article and find it insightful.You can access the previous articles below. The first provides a simple introduction to the topic of neural networks, to those who are unfamiliar. The second article covers more intermediary topics such as activation functions, neural architecture, and loss functions.Simple Introduction to Neural NetworksA detailed overview of neural networks with a wealth of examples and simple imagery.towardsdatascience.comComprehensive Introduction to Neural Network ArchitectureA detailed overview of neural architecture, activation functions, loss functions, output units.towardsdatascience.comNeural Network OptimizationCovering optimizers, momentum, adaptive learning rates, batch normalization, and more.towardsdatascience.comThese tutorials are largely based on the notes and examples from multiple classes taught at Harvard and Stanford in the computer science and data science departments.All the code that is discussed in this and subsequent tutorials on the topics of (fully connected) neural networks will be accessible through my Neural Networks GitHub repository, which can be found at the link below.mrdragonbear/Neural-NetworksContribute to mrdragonbear/Neural-Networks development by creating an account on GitHub.github.comBeale\u2019s FunctionNeural networks are fairly commonplace now in industry and research, but an embarrassingly large proportion of them are unable to work with them well enough to be able to produce high-performing networks that are capable of outperforming most other algorithms.When applied mathematicians develop a new optimization algorithm, one thing they like to do is test it on a test function, which is sometimes called an artificial landscape. These artificial landscapes help us find a way of comparing the performance of various algorithms in terms of their:Convergence (how fast they reach the answer)Precision (how close do they approximate the exact answer)Robustness (do they perform well for all functions or just a small subset)General performance (e.g. computational complexity)From just scrolling down the Wikipedia article on optimization test functions, you can see that some of the functions are pretty nasty. Many of them have been chosen as they highlight specific issues that can plague optimization algorithms. For this article, we will be looking at a relatively innocuous-looking function called the Beale function.The Beale function looks like this:The Beale function.This function does not look particularly terrifying, right? The reason this is a test function is that it assesses how well the optimization algorithms perform when in flat regions with very shallow gradients. In these cases, it is particularly difficult for gradient-based optimization procedures to reach any kind of minimum, as they are unable to learn effectively.The remainder of this article will follow the Jupyter notebook tutorial on my GitHub repository. We will discuss the way in which one would tackle this kind of artificial landscape. This landscape is analogous to the loss surface of a neural network. When training a neural network, the goal is to find the global minimum on the loss surface by performing some form of optimization \u2014 typically stochastic gradient descent.By learning how to approach a difficult optimization function, the reader should be more prepared to deal with real-life scenarios for implementing neural networks.For those of who reading that are not familiar with the Jupyter notebook, feel free to read more about it here.Before we touch any neural networks, we first have to define the function and find its minimum (otherwise, how will we know we got the right answer?). The first step (after importing any relevant packages) is to define the Beale function in our notebook:We then set some function boundaries since we have ballpark estimates for where the minimum is in this case (from our plot), as well as a step size for our grid mesh.We then make a mesh grid of points based on this information and are ready to find the minimum.Now we make a (terrible) initial guess.We then use the scipy.optimize function and see what answer pops out.This is the result:It looks like the answer is (3, 0.5), and, if you plug these values into the equation you do indeed find that this is the minimum (it also says this on the Wikipedia page).In the next section, we will start on our neural network.Optimization in Neural NetworksA neural network can be defined as a framework that combines inputs and tries to guess the output. If we are lucky enough to have some results, called \u201cthe ground truth\u201d, to compare the outputs produced by the network, we can calculate the error. So the network guesses, calculates some error function, guesses again, trying to minimize this error, guesses again, until the error does not go down any more. This is optimization.In neural networks, the most commonly used optimization algorithms are flavors of GD (gradient descent). The objective function used in gradient descent is the loss function which we want to minimize.This tutorial will lean heavily on Keras now, so I will give a brief Keras refresher.A Keras RefresherKeras is a Python library for deep learning that can run on top of both Theano or TensorFlow, two powerful Python libraries for fast numerical computing created and released by Facebook and Google, respectively.Keras was developed to make developing deep learning models as fast and easy as possible for research and practical applications. It runs on Python 2.7 or 3.5 and can seamlessly execute on GPUs and CPUs.Keras is built on the idea of a model. At its core we have a sequence of layers called the Sequential model which is a linear stack of layers. Keras also provides the functional API, a way to define complex models, such as multi-output models, directed acyclic graphs, or models with shared layers.We can summarize the construction of deep learning models in Keras using the Sequential model as follows:Define your model: create a Sequential model and add layers.Compile your model: specify loss function and optimizers and call the .compile() function.Fit your model: train the model on data by calling the .fit() function.Make predictions: use the model to generate predictions on new data by calling functions such as .evaluate() or .predict().You may be asking yourself \u2014 how can you examine the performance of the model as it is running? This is a good question, and the answer to that is using callbacks.Callbacks: taking a peek into our model while it\u2019s trainingYou can look at what is happening in various stages of your model by using callbacks. A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks) to the .fit() method of the Sequential or Model classes. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training.A callback function you are already familiar with is keras.callbacks.History(). This is automatically included in .fit().Another very useful one is keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint which saves the model with its weights at a certain point in the training. This can prove useful if your model is running for a long time and a system failure happens. Not all is lost then. It's a good practice to save the model weights only when an improvement is observed as measured by the acc, for example.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping stops the training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler will change the learning rate during training.We will apply some callbacks later. For full documentation on callbacks see https://keras.io/callbacks/.The first thing we must do is import a lot of different functions in order to make our lives easier.Another additional step you can do if you want your network to work using random numbers but for the result to be repeatable is to use a random seed. This basically produces the same sequence of numbers each time, although they are still pseudorandom (these are a great way for comparing models and also testing for reproducibility).Step 1 \u2014 Deciding on the network topology (not really considered optimization but is obviously very important)We will use the MNIST dataset which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0\u20139) whose dimension is 28x28 pixels. Each pixel is 8 bits so its value ranges from 0 to 255.Obtaining the dataset is very easy since there is a function for it built-in to Keras .Our output for our X and Y data is (60000, 28, 28) and (60000,1) respectively. It is always a good suggestion to print some of the data to check the values (and the data type if necessary).We can check the training data by looking at one image of each of the digits to make sure that none of them are missing from our data.The last check is for the dimensions of the training and test sets, which can be done relatively easily:We find that we have 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The next thing to do is preprocess the data.Preprocessing the dataTo run our NN we need to preprocess the data (these steps can be performed interchangeably):First, we need to make the 2D image arrays into 1D (flatten them). We can either perform this by using array reshaping with numpy.reshape() or the keras' method for this: a layer called keras.layers.Flatten which transforms the format of the images from a 2d-array (of 28 by 28 pixels), to a 1D-array of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels.Then we need to normalize the pixel values (give them values between 0 and 1) using the following transformation:In our case, the minimum is zero and the maximum is 255, so the formula becomes simply \ud835\udc65:=\ud835\udc65/255.We now want to one-hot encode our data.Now we are finally ready to build our model!Step 2 \u2014 Adjusting the learning rateOne of the most common optimization algorithms is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The hyperparameters that can be optimized in SGD are learning rate, momentum, decay and nesterov.Learning rate controls the weight at the end of each batch, and momentum controls how much to let the previous update influence the current weight update. Decay indicates the learning rate decay over each update, and nesterov takes the value \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d depending on if we want to apply Nesterov momentum.Typical values for those hyperparameters are lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, and nesterov=True.The learning rate hyperparameter goes into the optimizer function which we will see below. Keras has a default learning rate scheduler in the SGDoptimizer that decreases the learning rate during the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. The learning rate is decreased according to this formula:lr=lr\u00d71/(1+decay\u2217epoch)Source: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3Let\u2019s implement a learning rate adaptation schedule in Keras. We'll start with SGD and a learning rate value of 0.1. We will then train the model for 60 epochs and set the decay argument to 0.0016 (0.1/60). We also include a momentum value of 0.8 since that seems to work well when using an adaptive learning rate.Next, we build the architecture of the neural network:We can now run the model and see how well it performs. This took around 20 minutes on my machine and may be faster or slower on yours depending on your machine.After it has finished running, we can plot the accuracy and loss function as a function of epochs for the training and test sets to see how the network performed.The loss function plot looks as follows:Loss as a function of epochs.And this is the accuracy:We will now look at applying a customized learning rate.Apply a custom learning rate change using LearningRateSchedulerWrite a function that performs the exponential learning rate decay as indicated by the following formula:\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5f=\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5f\u2080 \u00d7 \ud835\udc52^(\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61)This is very similar to before so I will do this in one code block and describe the differences.We see here that the only thing that has changed here is the presence of the exp_decay function that we defined, and its use in the LearningRateScheduler function. Notice we also chose to add a few callbacks to our model this time.We can now plot the learning rate and loss functions as functions of the number of epochs. The learning rate plot is incredibly smooth as it follows our predefined exponentially decaying function.The loss function also looks smoother now as compared to before.This shows you that developing a learning rate scheduler can be a helpful way to improve neural network performance.Step 3 \u2014 Choosing an optimizer and a loss functionWhen constructing a model and using it to make our predictions, for example, to assign label scores to images (\u201ccat\u201d, \u201cplane\u201d, etc), we want to measure our success or failure by defining a \u201closs\u201d function (or objective function). The goal of optimization is to efficiently calculate the parameters/weights that minimize this loss function. keras provides various types of loss functions.Sometimes the \u201closs\u201d function measures the \u201cdistance\u201d. We can define this \u201cdistance\u201d between two data points in various ways suitable to the problem or dataset. The distance used depends on the data type and the specific problem that is being tackled. For example, in natural language processing (which analyses textual data), the Hamming distance is much more common to use.DistanceEuclideanManhattanothers such as Hamming which measures distances between strings, for example. The Hamming distance of \u201ccarolin\u201d and \u201ccathrin\u201d is 3.Loss functionsMSE (for regression)categorical cross-entropy (for classification)binary cross entropy (for classification)Step 4 \u2014 Deciding on the batch size and number of epochsThe batch size defines the number of samples that will be propagated through the network.For instance, let\u2019s say you have 1000 training samples and you want to set up a batch_size equal to 100. The algorithm takes the first 100 samples (from 1st to 100th) from the training dataset and trains the network. Next, it takes the second 100 samples (from 101st to 200th) and trains the network again. We can keep doing this procedure until we have propagated all samples through the network.Advantages of using a batch size < number of all samples:It requires less memory. Since you train the network using fewer samples, the overall training procedure requires less memory. That\u2019s especially important if you are not able to fit the whole dataset in your machine\u2019s memory.Typically networks train faster with mini-batches. That\u2019s because we update the weights after each propagation.Disadvantages of using a batch size < number of all samples:The smaller the batch the less accurate the estimate of the gradient will be.The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.One epoch means that each sample in the training dataset has had an opportunity to update the internal model parameters. An epoch is comprised of one or more batches.There are no hard and fast rules for selecting batch sizes or the number of epochs, and there is no guarantee that increasing the number of epochs provides a better result than a lesser number.Step 5 \u2014 Random restartsThis method does not seem to have an implementation in keras. It can be done easily by altering keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler. I will leave this as an exercise for the reader, but it essentially involves resetting the learning rate after a specified number of epochs for a finite number of times.Tuning Hyperparameters using Cross-ValidationNow instead of trying different values by hand, we will use GridSearchCV from Scikit-Learn to try out several values for our hyperparameters and compare the results.To do cross-validation with keras we will use the wrappers for the Scikit-Learn API. They provide a way to use Sequential Keras models (single-input only) as part of your Scikit-Learn workflow.There are two wrappers available:keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier(build_fn=None, **sk_params), which implements the Scikit-Learn classifier interface,keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_fn=None, **sk_params), which implements the Scikit-Learn regressor interface.Trying Different Weight InitializationsThe first hyperparameter we will try to optimize via cross-validation is different weight initializations.The results from our GridSearch are:We see that the best results are obtained either from the model using lecun_uniform initialization or glorot_uniform initialization and that we can achieve close to 97% accuracy with our network.Save Your Neural Network Model to JSONThe Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) is a data storage format for storing large arrays of data including values for the weights in a neural network.You can install HDF5 Python module: pip install h5pyKeras gives you the ability to describe and save any model using the JSON format.Cross-validation with more than one hyperparametersUsually, we are not interested in looking at how just one parameter changes, but how multiple parameter changes can affect our results. We can do cross-validation with more than one parameters simultaneously, effectively trying out combinations of them.Note: Cross-validation in neural networks is computationally expensive. Think before you experiment! Multiply the number of features you are validating on to see how many combinations there are. Each combination is evaluated using the k-fold cross-validation (k is a parameter we choose).For example, we can choose to search for different values of:batch sizenumber of epochsinitialization modeThe choices are specified into a dictionary and passed to GridSearchCV.We will now perform a GridSearch for batch size, number of epochs and initializer combined.One last question before we end: what do we do if the number of parameters and the number of values we have to cycle through in our GridSearchCV is particularly large?This can be a particularly troublesome problem \u2014 imagine a situation where there are 5 parameters being selected for and 10 potential values that we have selected for each parameter. The number of unique combinations of this is 10\u2075, which means we would have to train a ridiculously large number of networks. Clearly, it would be insanity to actually do it this way, so it is common to use RandomizedCV as an alternative.RandomizedCV allows us to specify all of our potential parameters, and then for each fold in the cross-validation, it selects a random subset of parameters to use for the current model. In the end, the user can select the optimal set of parameters and use these as an approximate solution.Final CommentsThank you for reading and I hope you found this article helpful and insightful.

Right from setting up the peer network and use the Node.js SDK to develop the tuna fish application which tracks a tuna\u2019s story from its capture till a chef cooks it.In this blockchain application, the blockchain will store the state of the system, in addition to the immutable record of transactions that created that state. A client application will be used to send transactions to the blockchain. The smart contracts (Chaincode) will encode some (if not all) of the business logic.What will we learn in this chapter?Write your first applicationStart with a test Hyperledger Fabric networkLearn the parameters of the sample smart contractDevelop the application to query and update ledger recordsRecap:Distributed ledger technology generally consists of three basic components:A data model that captures the current state of the ledger ( a time-stamped series of transactions cryptographically secured)A language of transactions that changes the ledger state [Smart Contracts / Chain code]A protocol used to build consensus among participants around which transactions will be accepted, and in what order, by the ledger.We are using Hyperledger Fabric, one of the 5 frameworks available within the Hyperledger universe to explore a way to bring some transparency to the Tuna Fish supply chain. Read more about the problem structure here, incase you are lost.Tuna Fish Application \u2014 High Level ArchitectureTuna Fish Application \u2014 Transaction Flow within Hyperledger FabricHow Applications Interact with the NetworkApplications use APIs to run smart contracts. In Hyperledger Fabric, these smart contracts are called chaincode. These contracts are hosted on the network, and identified by name and version. APIs are accessible with a software development kit, or SDK. Currently, Hyperledger Fabric has three options for developers: Node.js SDK, Java SDK, and CLI.Fabric Node.js SDKIn this exercise, we will be using the Node.js SDK (https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/) to interact with the network, and, therefore, the ledger. The Hyperledger Fabric Client SDK makes it easy to use APIs to interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. This section will help you write your first application, starting with a test Hyperledger Fabric network, then learning the parameters of the sample smart contract, and lastly, developing the application to query and update ledger records.For additional information, visit the Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK documentation: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-app-dev-env-setup.html.Fun Part : BlockChain ApplicationBe sure that you have the technical dependencies sorted out before you try to run this blockchain application.Hyperledger \u2014 Chapter 7 | Installing Hyperledger FabricThe first step in implementing the solution to fix the tuna fish supplychain is setting up the technical environment\u2026medium.comStep 1: Clone the repogit clone https://github.com/hyperledger/education.gitcd education/LFS171x/fabric-material/tuna-appMake sure you have Docker running on your machine before you run the next command. If you do not have Docker installed, return to Chapter 4, Technical Requirements.Also, make sure that you have completed the Installing Hyperledger Fabric section in this chapter before moving on to this application section, as you will likely experience errors.First, remove any pre-existing containers, as it may conflict with commands in this tutorial:docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)Let\u2019s explore the folder structure here for a bit:Once you executed the git clone it would have created this folder structure within your systemNow open the fabric-material in your favorite text editor.

Also, a channel is created and a peer is added.So you see this in your terminal& the channel creation along with few dummy records are createdStep 3: RegisterAdminCool. Now that the network is up. Let\u2019s registerAdmin.node registerAdmin.jsYou should get this output, basically an Admin is created with the required keys. YOu can open up registerAdmin.js to see the code. Basically, withe the Fabric CA client we check if an Admin is already registered, if not it enrolls with the CA client. Basic parameters such as enrollmentID, Secret are set. Then the user is created with FabricClient with membership ID, along with the public private key pair.registerAdmin.jsoutput on terminal after running \u201cnode regiserAdmin.js\u201dStep 4: RegisterUserNow that the network and admin are set, let\u2019s register an User.mosess-mbp:tuna-app Sam$ node registerUser.jsStore path:/Users/Sam/.hfc-key-storeSuccessfully loaded admin from persistenceFailed to register: Error: fabric-ca request register failed with errors [[{\"code\":20,\"message\":\"Authorization failure\"}]]Authorization failures may be caused by having admin credentials from a previous CA instance.Try again after deleting the contents of the store directory /Users/Sam/.hfc-key-storeDelete the key directory & Register Admin again.mosess-mbp:tuna-app Sam$ rm ~/.hfc-key-store/*mosess-mbp:tuna-app Sam$ node registerUser.jsStore path:/Users/Sam/.hfc-key-storeFailed to register: Error: Failed to get admin.... run registerAdmin.jsmosess-mbp:tuna-app Sam$ node registerAdmin.jsStore path:/Users/Sam/.hfc-key-storeSuccessfully enrolled admin user \"admin\"Assigned the admin user to the fabric client ::{\"name\":\"admin\",\"mspid\":\"Org1MSP\",\"roles\":null,\"affiliation\":\"\",\"enrollmentSecret\":\"\",\"enrollment\":{\"signingIdentity\":\"174630b086dc3d165c65b139fc2bee92bfe6f0749bf93672b28b823784349ebf\",\"identity\":{\"certificate\":\"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\\nFAK9awIgWV1GODLV/OhPnR42yNa+fdwkry/8IgWU27PcFN15oFQ=\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\\n\"}}}let\u2019s try and register user again.mosess-mbp:tuna-app Sam$ node registerUser.jsStore path:/Users/Sam/.hfc-key-storeSuccessfully loaded admin from persistenceSuccessfully registered user1 - secret:oDSXCnPBMrUCSuccessfully enrolled member user \"user1\"User1 was successfully registered and enrolled and is ready to intreact with the fabric networkIf you open up registerUser.js, you can see that we register user with the CA server and then enroll.Step 5: Run the serverThis step is the final step to run the application.

Each channel is an independent chain of transaction blocks containing only transactions for that particular channel. Chaincode /(Smart Contract) | It encapsulates both the asset definitions and the business logic (or transactions) for modifying those assets. Transaction invocations result in changes to the ledger. Ledger contains the current world state of the network and a chain of transaction invocations. A shared, permissioned ledger is an append-only system of records and serves as a single source of truth. Network is the collection of data processing peers that form a blockchain network. The network is responsible for maintaining a consistently replicated ledger.Ordering Service is a collection of nodes that orders transactions into a block.World State reflects the current data about all the assets in the network. This data is stored in a database for efficient access. Current supported databases are LevelDB and CouchDB.Membership Service Provider (MSP) manages identity and permissioned access for clients and peers.Nandri,Moses Sam PaulThis is a 10 part series.\u261e Please tap or click \u201c\u2665\ufe0e\u201d to help recommend this article to others and stay updated!You can reach me on Twitter, Medium or LinkedIn.Source: Linux Foundation, Whitepapers of Bitcoin, EthereumChapter 9: Chaincode in Tuna Fish ScenarioThis story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by 324,834+ people.Subscribe to receive our top stories here.", "responses": 12, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Hyperledger", "Hyperledger Fabric"]}, {"title": "An introduction to high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning", "post_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-high-dimensional-hyper-parameter-tuning-df5c0106e5a4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Thalles Silva", "author_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/@thalles.silva", "publish_date": "2018-12-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-22", "readtime": "5.40", "claps": 565, "voters": 82, "content": "An introduction to high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuningBest practices for optimizing ML modelsThalles SilvaFollowDec 13, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readIf you ever struggled with tuning Machine Learning (ML) models, you are reading the right piece.Hyper-parameter tuning refers to the problem of finding an optimal set of parameter values for a learning algorithm.Usually, the process of choosing these values is a time-consuming task.Even for simple algorithms like Linear Regression, finding the best set for the hyper-parameters can be tough. With Deep Learning, things get even worse.Some of the parameters to tune when optimizing neural nets (NNs) include:learning ratemomentumregularizationdropout probabilitybatch normalizationIn this short piece, we talk about the best practices for optimizing ML models. These practices come in hand mainly when the number of parameters to tune exceeds two or three.The problem with Grid SearchGrid Search is usually a good choice when we have a small number of parameters to optimize. For two or even three different parameters, it might be the way to go.For each hyper-parameter, we define a set of candidate values to explore.Then, the idea is to exhaustively try every possible combination of the values of the individual parameters.For each combination, we train and evaluate a different model.In the end, we keep the one with the smallest generalization error.The main problem with Grid Search is that it is an exponential time algorithm. Its cost grows exponentially with the number of parameters.In other words, if we need to optimize p parameters and each one takes at most v values, it runs in O(v\u1d56) time.Also, Grid Search is not as effective in exploring the hyper-parameter space as we may think.Take a look at the code above again. Using this setup, we are going to train a total of 256 different models. Note that if we decide to add one more parameter, the number of experiments would increase to 1024.However, this setup only explores four different values for each hyper-parameter. That is it, we train 256 models to only explore four values of the learning rate, regularization, and so on.Besides, Grid Search usually requires repetitive trials. Take the learning_rate_search values from the code above as an example.learning_rate_search = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]Suppose that after our first run (256 model trials), we get the best model with a learning rate value of 0.01.In this situation, we should try to refine our search values by \u201czooming in\u201d on the grid around 0.01 in the hope to find an even better value.To do this, we could setup a new Grid Search and redefine the learning rate search range such as:learning_rate_search = [0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.04, 0.06]But what if we get the best model with a learning rate value was 0.0001?Since this value is at the very edge of our initial search range, we should shift the values and try again with a different set like:learning_rate_search = [0.0001, 0.00006, 0.00002]And possibly try to refine the range after finding a good candidate.All these details only emphasize how time-consuming hyper-parameter search can be.A better approach \u2014 Random SearchHow about choosing our hyper-parameter candidate values at random? As not intuitive as it might seem, this idea is almost always better than Grid Search.A little bit of intuitionNote that some of the hyper-parameters are more important than others.The learning rate and the momentum factor, for example, are more worth tuning than all others.However, with the above exception, it is hard to know which ones play major roles in the optimization process. In fact, I would argue that the importance of each parameter might change for different model architectures and datasets.Suppose we are optimizing over two hyper-parameters \u2014 the learning rate and the regularization strength. Also, take into consideration that only the learning rate matters for the problem.In the case of Grid Search, we are going to run nine different experiments, but only try three candidates for the learning rate.Image Credit: Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization, James Bergstra, Yoshua Bengio.Now, take a look at what happens if we sample the candidates uniformly at random. In this scenario, we are actually exploring nine different values for each parameter.If you are not yet convinced, suppose we are optimizing over three hyper-parameters. For example, the learning rate, the regularization strength, and momentum.Optimizing over 3 hyper-parameters using Grid Search.For Grid Search, we would be running 125 training runs, but only exploring five different values of each parameter.On the other hand, with Random Search, we would be exploring 125 different values of each.How to do itIf we want to try values for the learning rate, say within the range of 0.1 to 0.0001, we do:Note that we are sampling values from a uniform distribution on a log scale.You can think of the values -1 and -4 (for the learning rate) as the exponents in the interval [10e-1, 10e-4].If we do not use a log-scale, the sampling will not be uniform within the given range. In other words, you should not attempt to sample values like:In this situation, most of the values would not be sampled from a \u2018valid\u2019 region. Actually, considering the learning rate samples in this example, 72% of the values would fall in the interval [0.02, 0.1].Moreover, 88% in the sampled values would come from the interval [0.01, 0.1]. That is, only 12% of the learning rate candidates, 3 values, would be sampled from the interval [0.0004, 0.01]. Do not do that.In the graphic below, we are sampling 25 random values from the range [0.1,0.0004]. The plot in the top left shows the original values.In the top right, notice that 72% of the sampled values are in the interval [0.02, 0.1]. 88% of the values lie within the range [0.01, 0.1].The bottom plot shows the distribution of values. Only 12% of the values are in the interval [0.0004, 0.01]. To solve this problem, sample the values from a uniform distribution in a log-scale.A similar behavior would happen with the regularization parameter.Also, note that like with Grid Search, you need to consider the two cases we mentioned above.If the best candidate falls very near the edge, your range might be off and should be shifted and re-sampled. Also, after choosing the first good candidates, try re-sampling to a finer range of values.In conclusion, these are the key takeaways.If you have more than two or three hyper-parameters to tune, prefer Random Search. It is faster/easier to implement and converges faster than Grid Search.Use an appropriate scale to pick your values. Sample from a uniform distribution in a log-space. This will allow you to sample values equally distributed across the parameters ranges.Regardless of Random or Grid Search, pay attention to the candidates you choose. Make sure the parameter\u2019s ranges are properly set and refine the best candidates if possible.Thanks for reading!

What was it that assisted your decision-making? Did you choose based on price, color, label, aesthetics, availability? Was your decision economically rational? Meaning, you weighed up the pros and cons, and then decided based on a cost benefit of what was best suited for you? Economists love to assume that humans are logical when spending their money, but don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not. Turns out people buy stuff based on many influencing factors that they have no idea are there.Our entire economic system is based on a pretence that free agents will use rational choices when consuming, and that producers will seek to be effective providers of products that meet their needs based on expressed preferences. Rational economics sees the human as being a conscious conservative agent, operating on a rigid set of self-interests and cost-benefit analysis. That, however, is completely opposite of what humans are actually like.In this series of essays, I am exploring some of the \u2018system failures\u2019 at play in the beautifully complex world around us. In the first essay I looked at systems of enforced disposability and how they feed into the global waste crises we have designed for ourselves. In this second one, I am diving into the power of incentives in regard to how our economic system is driving significant change to the planet based on invisible forces influencing our unsuspecting brains.The Predictable Irrationally of Economic ChoiceGenerally speaking, people don\u2019t participate in the economy based on logic and rational decision making so much as they do based on a concoction of emotion and cognitive biases. What actually supports our decision making is often at a loss for us even to describe.The proposition of a homo economicus assumes that the modern human acts rationally, weighs up the cost benefit to them based on a matrix of economically rational decisions, but this does not exist. What often happens is that humans, being complex social beings, respond to all sorts of stimuli and inputs which result in overwhelmed, love-stricken, or apathetic consumers of goods thrust upon them. People end up participating in the economy based on invisible influencing forces.Behavioral economist Dan Ariely has contributed a wealth of studies and propositions that demonstrate the predictably irrational behaviors of humans when it comes to economic decision making. The explosion of research into cognitive experiences, biases, and motivators has helped us sociologists gain a much deeper understanding of the complexity in decision making that goes on behind the scenes when people participate in the economy (and marketing agents know this, too).Scientists have discovered that much of our decision making happens deep within the emotional center, the limbic system of our brain. This subconscious part is fundamentally ruled by memories, emotions, and neurochemicals, and triggered by external stimuli. Some researchers claim that up to 90% of our daily decisions are made at this subconscious level, meaning that only a small percentage of the decisions we make in our daily lives are decided upon by the cerebral cortex \u2014 which is the part you and I have conscious control over (interested in this? Here and here and here and here are some more articles on conscious decisions making).The rest is completely unbeknownst to you or anyone else.This would explain why we all do very odd things, end up in weird life choices, or own things we never imagined we would. Added on top of all of this are the shared cognitive biases that we have; from choice paralysis to confirmation bias, humans are essentially winging it through the world, responding to all sorts of external inputs, often specifically designed to manipulate these human brain quirks and to evoke many of our latent human desires.So, the \u2018Economy\u2019, as proposed in a purely economically rational way, is fundamentally flawed when you bring the chaotic and emotionally-driven human being into the equation.Manipulating DesiresSigmund Freud\u2019s nephew, Edward Bernays, was one of the first people to work on evoking and manipulating latent human desires in the marketing process. A United States propagandist during World War One, he turned his skills into commercial gain by starting the profession of Public Relations (PR) after the war.His incredible list of clients ranged from Alcoa to Lucky Strike Cigarettes. Learning all the discoveries of his famous uncle, he experimented with the mass manipulation of the consumer base. He proudly shares how he got women to smoke by calling cigarettes \u201cfreedom torches,\u201d changed the American diet from a light one of toast to the heavy fat-filled eggs and bacon for the pork industry, and influenced people to approve of fluoride in water for his aluminum smelting client (fluoride is a byproduct of this process and thus, a waste product that needed a new market).If you take away the human and environmental costs of what he managed to get the population to do, and just focus on his tactics, it\u2019s easy to see a pure genius in his approaches. He was an advocate for a fully controlled social system; in 1955 he wrote a paper called the \u201cEngineering of Consent\u201d, in which he outlines his opinion on the need for governments to control the masses for their own safely and benefit.\u201cThis is an age of mass production. In the mass production of materials, a broad technique has been developed and applied to their distribution. In this age, too, there must be a technique for the mass distribution of ideas.\u201d \u2014 Manipulating Public Opinion, American Journal of Sociology 33 (May, 1928), p. 958\u2013971Fast forward to the present day, and it\u2019s easy to see many of Bernays\u2019 tactics openly employed by marketing agencies and PR firms around the world. The collateral impact of these manipulative and controlling approaches is less obvious, but significantly problematic. For starters, it really throws into question the locus of agency that everyday citizens have. If we are seen as robotic decision makers by the economy, and emotionally manipulatable money bags by the marketers, then what choice do we actually have between these two?Inventing the EconomyWe live in a complex interconnected world, and humans, like many other primates, operate as a social herd, following subtle cues of those around us and mimicking the status quo of the day. This means that many of our actions in the economy are directed by invisible but very meticulously designed forces \u2014 sounds like a conspiracy theory, but it\u2019s not. This is the way the economy works and why it was invented in the first place.Yes, the economy as a concept and as a system was entirely made up. Prior to the late 1930\u2019s, there was no mention at all of the \u201ceconomy\u201d. The term first emerged in 1937 when President Roosevelt started to talk about this invisible thing called The Economy as a way of explaining the bigger picture of commerce and trade in the USA.At this point in time, individual industries would measure their own activities, but no one had added all of these up to get an idea as to what type of economic activity was happening in the country as a whole. Thus, an increasing need to understand the cumulative state of affairs for a nation resulted in the first national assessment of industrial activity in the US, and a published report called \u201cNational Income 1929\u20131932\u201d became a bestseller.Shortly thereafter came the need for a country to assess its ability to fight a war or feed its people. The economy could now be measured, and the need to mechanically assess the inventory of the nation was tasked by a very dry and pragmatic man, Simon Kuznet, who came up with the measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although he started to perform this complex accounting for the US\u2019s war effort during WW2, what is fascinating about the story of Kuznick and GDP is that he himself was opposed to the idea of using GDP as a broad measurement tool, because it was so one-dimensional, only accounting for the goods and services produced and consumed in an economy.\u201cThe welfare of a nation, can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income.\u201d \u2014 Simon Kuznet, 1934 (source)This became part of a new type of ordered intellectual revolution where the famed economist John Maynard Keynes started to talk about the economy being something governments could control \u2014 because after all, if you can measure it, you can control it.So it came to be that the health and wealth of nations would be measured by a very limited accounting system that\u2019s akin to only measuring the ability of students to identify letters in an alphabet but not on whether they can string them together to make words and sentences.This really fit within the worldview of the day; the mechanical, reductionist perspective was well-established, and the measurable, controlled economy was ordered and dictated actions that could influence society, increase prosperity, and change the world. And that it did. The rapid changes to industries like agriculture and manufacturing ensured that globally, GDP would become the gold standard of economic measurement.Supported by international bodies set up after WW2 such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, GDP supported the decisions on who received funds, in addition to ranking and rating countries\u2019 economic health. Now, the measuring of an entire country\u2019s economic position is standardized with GDP (except in Bhutan, who has bucked the trend and measures Gross Domestic Happiness).Current GDP of Nations. Source: World BankThe issue is that GDP is a reductive assessment of what stuff gets produced and then what gets consumed within a nation. Weirdly though, stuff sold in a store in France to a French consumer but produced by an American company with HQ in the US will contribute to the GDP of the US, not France. And, a disease outbreak that kills thousands of people and requires them to be buried will show a positive spike in GDP for the sale of coffins and funeral services, despite the tragic social toll that this would have.In fact, GDP is so rigid as an assessment of a nation\u2019s wealth that when Italy recently decided to start including the economic activity of the Mafia and other black market activities, it jumped up 18% overnight!Traditional economic theory might argue that the illegal activities of a community known to trade in weapons, drugs, and desperation is a socially undesirable element, not really rationally economical, and not something that should be seen as positive for a country. But it\u2019s actually now part of the European Accounting Standard to include illegal activity in GDP measurements.This points to one of the major issues with GDP \u2014 as a fundamentally flawed system, it places emphasis on incentives that encourage socially undesirable acts and does not account, in any way, shape, or form, for things that offer collective benefit and contribute to the social and environmental health of our nations. GDP lacks empathy, conscious, and accountability. For example the recent hurricanes that decimated parts of the US increased GDP.No environmental services, nor negative impacts caused by pollution, for example, are accounted for. GDP basically assumes that everything before extraction and processing doesn\u2019t exist! There is no accounting for the changing of natural systems or waste production, despite the fact that every single metal that is mined or tools that are made have to come from nature, and will eventually have to be returned to the planet and all of this will have impacts on our collective ability to continue to produce goods and thus, the ability for nations to have continual economic growth.Another fundamental flaw to GDP is the zero accounting of social labor \u2014 services provided for free by care givers and family members, like raising a child. One could argue that an economy is healthy based on its ability to produce good contributors to economic activity, but instead of accounting for such services, again GDP assumes that consumers are invisible until they start earning and spending money.There are many limitations to GDP, but the fundamental issue here is that all of these things, environmental services and human contributions, under the GDP-based model of measurement, are externalities, things that are not accounted for in the system. But they are all fundamental to the system. Without these elements, there would be no economic activity, no goods or services, no gross domestic production.You Get What You IncentivizeMany people blame environmental and social issues on capitalism, on the governing structures of society, or on consumerism, but if you look at the entire system and drill down, you will always find motivators and incentives and the way they are manipulated as being a significant force in what is reinforcing unsustainability.Incentives are central to economics. we all respond to rewards and punishments, are motivated by extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. In fact, it\u2019s odd that anyone does anything without some sort of incentive to take action. We get an education because it\u2019s good for our job prospects, just as we get up and go to work to earn money to trade for stuff that we value as a reward for hard work.Humans design incentive structures that increase activities in the economy based on activating self-interest through different mechanisms, like money and status. Edward Bernays knew this and used it, and now we live in a global economic system that is set up to incentivize consumption over all else.Perverse incentives often lead to unintended consequences, as was the case with the European Union\u2019s introduction of a 10% mandate on biofuels in petrol, which incentivized farmers to change the use of their land from food agriculture to biofuel crops, which contributed to a world food crises in 2006. Paying people to donate blood backfired and reduced the amount of donations; reintroducing the altruistic element of blood donations made the reward system changes, increasing people\u2019s willingness to contribute.Combine all of these elements, a consumption-fueled accounting system, deep-seeded emotional desires manipulated by marketers, and the incentive system of rewards and punishments, and we have a reinforcing feedback loop of exponential externalities.GDP is designed to incentivize unscrupulous consumption, as it does not account for any impacts outside of goods produced and sold, which in turn, motivates all agents in the system to enforce a hyper-consumption loop.To decouple consumption with the wealth and success of nations, and move to a more true-cost accounting method, we must also account for the social and environmental aspects of our global and national economies, not just the purely physical benefits.The solution is GDP + Sustainable Development = SDGDPMy proposition is for global economic measurements to be redesigned to include social and environmental services, along with the assessment of unintended consequences and negative externalities. This GDP plus Sustainable Development (SD) approach would incentivize agents within the economy to rapidly transition to a more sustainable and circular economy, as everyone would have to take a more realistic assessment of the externalities that occur as a result of the current economic activity.SD is about the integration and equitable understanding of the social, economic, and environmental considerations of what we do as individuals, industries, and countries. Until we marry it to our economic measurement tools, we will be plagued by negative externalities and obscure consequences.Internalizing negative externalities into the economic measurement tools we use to assess the health and wealth of our nations is critical if we are to achieve a future that works better than today. As this will shift the incentives of group and individual behaviors, it will also change the goal posts for economic successes through accounting for the losses associated with the true cost of production, like the future loss in productivity as a result of losses in ecosystem services, or the social health of a nation being reduced by a war or increases in mental health issues. All of these things must be accounted for as they affect every citizen and ultimately impact the ability for any economy to function.To not include the social and environmental costs in how we measure success is akin to ignoring the entire body when a doctor is diagnosing a disease. Our reductionist approaches have shown us that reinforcing a hyper consumption-loop over all else leads to losses greater than we can account for.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014In this series I am exploring the system failures that account for significant externalities and propose some provocations for shifting the status quo of these.I have lots of resources and tools in systems thinking, circular economy, sustainable design, and techniques for redesign the world so it works better for all of us,All illustrations by Emma Segal", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Economics", "Sustainable Development", "Consumption", "Circulareconomy", "Sustainability"]}, {"title": "Hyperledger Fabric \u2014 the 20 most important terms made simple", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ben_longstaff/hyperledger-fabric-the-20-most-important-terms-made-simple-2753f925db4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ben Longstaff", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ben_longstaff", "publish_date": "2019-01-18", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-14", "readtime": "2.36", "claps": 248, "voters": 71, "content": "Hyperledger Fabric \u2014 the 20 most important terms made simpleYour cheatsheet for understanding some awesome techBen LongstaffFollowJan 18 \u00b7 3 min readI took a couple of days to sit down and read the docs for Hyperledger Fabric.

CC1 is a channel configuration.O4 is a ordering service. N is the Hyperledger network. image sourceIf I was a gambling man, which I am, my money is on them for enterprise adoption.Below is an explanation of the key terms.Anchor PeerThis gets used for communications between organisations. It makes peers in different organisations aware of each other.BlocksConsist of a header, block data (transactions) and block metadata (information about nodes involved with creating the block).Certificate AuthoritiesEveryone who wants to interact with the networks needs an identity. The CA provides the means for each actor to have a verifiable digital identity. Hyperledger Fabric has a built in CA component for use in the blockchain network.ChaincodeThe Hyperledger Fabric term for a smart contract. Note that chaincode does not have to be installed on every peer in a channel.ChannelA channel allows a group of participants to create a separate ledger of transactions. The transactions are only visible to the members of the channel.Channel ConfigurationRules that govern the channel, the channel is governed by the channel members. The channel configuration is separate from the network configuration.ConsortiumA group of organisations that share a need to transact.Committing PeerEvery peer in the channel.Endorsing PeerEvery peer that has the smart contract installed can be an endorsing peer.Endorsement PolicyThe rules for which organisations much approve a transaction before the other organisations will accept a copy. This is specific to the chaincode.Leader PeerAn organization can have multiple peers in a channel. Only one peer from the organization needs to receive the transactions. The leader distributes transactions from the orderer.Membership Service ProviderIs a trusted authority.The MSP identifies which Root Certificate Authorities (CA) and Intermediate CA\u2019s are trusted by the network. The MSP identifies what roles different actors in an organization can play in the network.Nodes join the network through a Membership Service Provider.LedgerThis is an append only file while can be used to recreate the world state.Ordering NodesIs like a network administration point. The ordering nodes support the application channels for ordering transactions into blocks.Peer NodesEach peer maintains a copy of the ledger for each channel it is a member of.PoliciesThese determine who has control over the network configuration.Private Data CollectionThis is used for keeping the data in a transaction confidential. The data is stored in a private database that is separated from the channel ledger.Public Key InfrastructureThis provides secure communication in a network. CAs issue digital certificates that get used to authenticate messages in the network. The PKI provides a list of identities and the MSP says which of them are part of an organization.System ChaincodeIs code that defines operating parameters for the entire channel.Lifecycle and configuration system chaincode defines the rules for the channel.

It\u2019d been days since he\u2019d had a decent meal, walking the hard streets of San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district.San Francisco, home of Hyperledger. (Photo by Jared Erondu on Unsplash)Brott, a meth addict could go for days without eating (methamphetamine has that effect on some people), but ever since he decided to go cold turkey for a week (mainly because he had run out of money and ways to make it), his body rebelled against him, demanding both food and drugs.But other than the Glide Memorial Church, which doled out perhaps one meal a day, until it ran out, there just weren\u2019t all that many places Brott knew where to head to for a meal.To be sure, Brott wasn\u2019t always a meth addict.He\u2019d graduated top of his class at Mission High School, with a particular talent for math and science and had several college offers.But after his father left his family, things spiraled downwards for Brott relatively quickly as these things often do.First, he, his mother and two younger siblings lost the house. As the eldest in the family, Brott fell the hardest as it became his job to now provide for the family.With little more than a high school diploma in a city where a bachelor\u2019s degree barely gets you an interview, Brott bounced from one menial job to another, working wherever he could.The mind-numbing meaninglessness of his situation led him to experiment with drugs to take the edge off. Initially, it was just marijuana, but when a friend at work introduced him to crystal meth, things soon spiraled out of control.Out of work, homeless and disavowed by his own family who felt that he had become a different person altogether, Brott wandered San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district, panhandling for money to feed his addiction, but determined to eventually get clean.So on autumn (what counts as autumn in San Francisco anyway) morning in 2015, when Brott saw a post on a bulletin board at a co-working space in the city\u2019s Mission District, for a Hyperledger education session that promised lunch, he immediately signed up.That initial contact with Hyperledger, a consortium, which counts backers such as IBM, to bring blockchain applications businesses became a bigger high for Brott than crystal meth.Early blockchain solutions lacked computing power. (Photo by Jo\u00e3o Silas on Unsplash)When he understood the implications of blockchain technology, the Halal Guys meal that Brott had had for that autumn in 2015 wasn\u2019t the only free lunch, it opened Brott to the possibilities of coding for the blockchain.Brott, who had always demonstrated a penchant for logical structures quickly developed a love for Hyperledger and started attending whatever cryptocurrency and blockchain meetups that were on offer for free throughout the city, free meals notwithstanding.Before he knew it, Brott was sober and working for IBM, as a Hyperledger advocate, giving out free lunches and teaching strangers the magic of blockchain technology as well as coding with Hyperledger.Please Ask For PermissionBut while Hyperledger uses blockchain technology, it is an altogether different animal from the blockchains that underpin cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 which are public blockchains.Hyperledger represents the ultimate oxymoron, a centrally-manageable decentralized database that leverages the immutability of the blockchain, with the traditional tech walled-garden approach.Because public blockchains are permissionless and transactions are subject to inspection, many companies have been drawn to private blockchains, which allow transactions to be kept private, but still leverage the advantage of a distributed ledger, with its myriad applications.So when Hyperledger, accepted its first code linking businesses directly to a public blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, it was a big deal.Because some functions do require privacy. (Photo by Amy Reed on Unsplash)Known as Hyperledger Besu, the open-source codebase is almost identical to an existing Ethereum-based enterprise solution called Pantheon, developed by Joseph Lubin\u2019s (a co-founder of Ethereum) ConsenSys, which has been running since April this year.To be sure, the debate over whether Hyperledger was designed to expand in such a way \u2014 by adding new codebases, or converge into a more unified offering \u2014 was always going to be a contentious issue and stirred up heated debates as to the main objective of Hyperledger itself.But ultimately, the consortium, which also counts investment banking giant JP Morgan and chipmaker Intel as premier members, voted unanimously in favor of adding the Ethereum codebase.And while some purists may decry the expansion of Hyperledger Besu as an encroachment on the decentralized company-led ethos of Ethereum \u2014 perhaps the market is as yet not ready for true decentralization.With memories of the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack that led to the fork in Ethereum, still fresh in the community\u2019s mind, perhaps now is the time for mending fences and moving forward with a hybrid approach towards blockchains \u2014 which is precisely what Hyperledger Besu represents.Developmental SupportBecause Hyperledger Besu was approved by the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee, the rebranded Ethereum client will receive support training new users, certification of developers, working with high stakes businesses and will be more easily integrated with existing codebases, which may ease the path to greater adoption by enabling companies on competing networks to work together.More importantly, given the resources available to Hyperledger Besu, more developers, coders, and enthusiasts, including those like Brott who were just out in search of a free lunch, may in return get free training on adopting and using the Ethereum protocol as part of their Hyperledger Besu learning sessions.With Hyperledger managing the permissioned networks that companies are used to, Hyperledger Besu provides the off-ramp from public blockchains where companies are happy to share specific datasets \u2014 provenance, for instance, is one obvious area \u2014 the ability to track the origin and source of goods and services \u2014 to areas such as sensitive customer data which live better off-chain.In many ways, the addition of the Ethereum codebase to Hyperledger marries the best of both worlds \u2014 private, permissioned blockchains for the parts firms want to keep to themselves melded with public blockchains for data that firms are proud to showcase to the rest of the world.They may look the same, but how do you know they came from the same place? (Photo by Raquel Mart\u00ednez on Unsplash)Among the existing blockchain codebases Hyperledger Besu might be integrated with are Hyperledger Fabric \u2014 which was originally developed by IBM, Hyperledger Sawtooth, created by Intel, Hyperledger Caliper, made by Huawei and Hyperledger Grid, developed by Cargill.Given the size and significance of the developers of these codebases, they have already seen to support significant projects, including IBM Food Trust Network, which was created to allow consumers to track the food supply chain and counts Golden State Foods, Nestle and Wal-Mart as among its corporate users.Hyperledger Sawtooth has seen use in Salesforce Blockchain, which makes it easier to build networks of companies that share a common record of transactions.The major break from the other Hyperledger codebases and Hyperledger Besu is that while the current Hyperledger codebase only allows networks of invited companies that already trust each other to participate, streamlining their work processes through the use of a common, distributed ledger, Besu also stretches outwards to allow integration with the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 allowing anyone to create their own public, permissionless networks on the main Ethereum blockchain.Do You Speak My language?And Hyperledger has made Ethereum even more enterprise-friendly in a big way \u2014 by relying on Java.While Solidity, an object-oriented programming language developed for writing smart contracts, is the primary language for Ethereum, as well as other private blockchains and blockchains that compete with Ethereum, it is a relatively new language and represents another language which developers, programmers and software engineers must learn, using what precious time they already don\u2019t have.Hyperledger Besu, on the other hand, relies on Java, which has been popular among enterprise developers for decades and is compliant with standards which were first developed by the non-profit Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.And it\u2019s not just the languages available for building on the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s the issue of hiring as well.While it may be relatively easy to hire a Java programmer, it\u2019s not so straightforward finding one with the programming chops for Solidity.And unlike many other blockchain codebases, Hyperledger Besu and the Hyperledger suite of blockchain solutions adhere to the Apache 2.0 software license \u2014 which means that companies which build on the blockchain infrastructure, or while using any of the open-source tools, still retain full ownership of any intellectual property they create.Although blockchain solutions have the potential to benefit myriad business applications, companies have thus far been slow to use public blockchains like Ethereum for fear that their proprietary information, counterparties to transactions and their trade data, would be made available to public scrutiny or copied by competitors.Some things are suitable for transparency. (Photo by Stuart Guest-Smith on Unsplash)Hyperledger Besu claims to have addressed these privacy concerns with a permissioned system that lets users control who can access a network, as well as the ability to temporarily move some transactions off the public blockchain, which in many ways marries the best of both worlds \u2014 companies get to keep what they want private, while still being able to leverage public blockchains, in this case Ethereum, for other data.Hyperledger Besu\u2019s admission into the Hyperledger suite of blockchain solutions marks a watershed moment and comes on the back of years of effort by the Ethereum and blockchain development community to support more enterprise-driven blockchain solutions.Speaking to Forbes, Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director at Hyperledger says that the admission of Hyperledger Besu marks a new phase of public blockchain integration with private blockchains,\u201cHyperledger\u2019s first goal was just to prove the concept of enterprise blockchain, let\u2019s get some stuff out there that can be deployed into production.\u201d\u201cAnd now that those bets are paying off, now that we see a lot of success, over time our mission has to evolve to support the hybrid models.\u201d\u201cHow do we get more efficiency, rather than just being a team of rivals?\u201dToday, Hyperledger consists of over 250 members representing some of the biggest names in the business from across the globe, including Airbus, Accenture, American Express and Chinese search giant Baidu.But what\u2019s even more exciting is the vibrancy of the developer community that is crucial to Hyperledger Besu\u2019s long term success and the rise of Ethereum as a preferred enterprise public blockchain solution.In the four months since Hyperledger Besu\u2019s launch, over 100 updates for the codebase have already been added. And while it\u2019s impossible to know for sure the exact number of projects using Hyperledger because it is open-source software, Behlendorf estimates that between 100 to 200 projects are actively using it.The move towards embracing enterprises is a step in the right direction, both for the blockchain industry as a whole as well as for Ethereum, currently the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.With the increasing development of Ethereum-based enterprise solutions, Ethereum continues to grow according to an entirely different narrative to that of Bitcoin.While Bitcoin continues to serve its role as a digital gold equivalent, a store of value and a macro hedge \u2014 Ethereum represents a vision of a decentralized \u201cworld\u201d computer \u2014 where computing power in and of itself becomes a form of currency and therefore value.Altcoin Magazine (@Alt__Magazine) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from Altcoin Magazine (@Alt__Magazine).

Since a muscle moves and changes shape as the joint rotates, its leverage changes, and so the amount of muscle force required to produce a given joint torque changes. When the muscle has good leverage, the joint produces a high torque for a given muscle force. When the same muscle has poor leverage, the joint produces a small torque for the same muscle force.Muscle activation \u2014 in order to produce force, a muscle must receive a signal from the central nervous system. The size of this signal determines the voluntary activation, which is the proportion of the total number of motor units that are recruited. Voluntary activation changes with joint angle, which means that voluntary and involuntary joint torque-angle curves can differ from one another. In other words, a muscle may be capable of producing more force at a given joint angle than it actually does, because voluntary activation is reduced at that point.Length-tension relationship \u2014 each muscle contains fascicles, which are bundles of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers change their capacity to produce force depending on their length, because they are made up of long strings of sarcomeres. Each sarcomere produces force according to the amount of overlap between the actin and myosin crossbridges, and according to the amount of stretch of its passive elements. This combination of factors tends to make a fascicle produce a high level of force when it is at a moderate length (when there is maximum overlap between the actin and myosin myofilaments of each sarcomere) and also at a long length (when the passive elements are very stretched).Antagonist muscle activation \u2014 during some multi-joint exercises, the behavior of two-joint muscles at neighboring joints can lead to changes in the muscle activation of antagonist (opposing) muscles. For example, in the squat, the activation of the hamstrings seems to increase with increasing depth, when lifting heavy weights, and this will increase the quadriceps muscle force that is required to produce any given knee extension joint torque.While each of these factors can have a meaningful effect on our ability to produce a turning force at a joint, the internal moment arm is the factor that varies the most widely, and so it has the greatest effect on our capacity to produce a joint torque at any given joint angle.What determines the requirement for a turning force at any given joint angle?While joint torque-angle curves describe the way in which our capacity for producing a joint torque changes with joint angle, external resistance curves describe the required joint torque at each joint angle, or at a point in an exercise range of motion.External resistance curves are determined by two main factors:External moment arm length \u2014 the joint torque that we must exert to lift a weight is at least equal to the turning force that the weight exerts on the joint. This turning force is determined partly by the size of the weight, and partly by the leverage of the weight on the joint. When we lift a barbell or dumbbell, this leverage is determined by the horizontal distance between the weight and the joint. This is why the biceps curl is hardest in the middle of the movement, when the forearm is horizontal and the weight is furthest from the elbow. It is also why the squat is hardest near to the bottom of the movement, when the hip and knee joints are furthest in a horizontal direction from the barbell.External resistance type \u2014 the object providing the external resistance affects the amount of force that is required at each point in the movement. For example, when we lift a weight, we must overcome the forces of both gravity and inertia. Gravity is constant at all points during the lift, but we only need to overcome inertia when we are accelerating the weight, which is at the start. In contrast, towards the end of the lift, we can allow the weight to decelerate, and this reduces the required force. This means that anytime we lift a weight, the force required is increased at the beginning and decreased at the end, compared to a completely constant resistance. In contrast, if we use elastic resistance for strength training, we must overcome the tension exerted as the material is deformed, and this tension increases progressively with increasing length. Therefore, any exercise is easy at the start, and becomes much harder towards the end.Unless you often switch between weights and elastic resistance in your training, the factor that differs most between exercise variations is the external moment arm length. Even so, external moment arm length and external resistance type can each have large effects on the required joint torque at any point in the exercise range of motion.What are the different types of strength curves?Strength curves of most of the common exercises used in the gym tend to follow one or other of the following broad patterns:Flat \u2014 if a strength curve is flat, then this means that we experience the exercise to be similarly difficult throughout its range of motion. Some machines are designed to have fairly flat strength curves, and we can also make some free weights exercises have flatter strength curves by adding elastic resistance to the barbell.Bell-shaped \u2014 if a strength curve is bell-shaped, then this means that we experience the exercise as most difficult in the middle. The bell shape can be fairly flat, or it can be quite pronounced. The standing biceps curl is the classic example of a bell-shaped strength curve, since it is hardest when the forearm is parallel to the floor.Linear ascending \u2014 if a strength curve is linear ascending, then this means that we experience the exercise as most difficult at the start of the lifting (concentric) phase. The barbell squat is the most commonly-used example of a linear ascending strength curve, since it is hardest at the bottom of the movement.Linear descending \u2014 if a strength curve is linear descending, then this means that we experience the exercise as most difficult at the end of the lifting (concentric) phase. The best example of this type of strength curve is the dumbbell lateral raise, which is so difficult at the top that it is nearly impossible to pause in that position, unless a very light weight is used.In the examples listed above, the main factor that contributes to the exercise strength curve is the external moment arm length, but for the purposes of understanding the effects on hypertrophy, we need to be aware of how both the capacity and the requirement to produce force are altered.How can exercise strength curves affect hypertrophy? (active and passive elements)When measuring the effects of a single exercise variation, performed in the same way, the number of stimulating reps performed by a muscle in a workout determines the hypertrophic stimulus.The number of stimulating reps is probably the best way of representing training volume (and therefore time under tension). Training volume seems to have a dose-reponse relationship with muscle growth, although the exact shape of that relationship is still unclear.However, not all reps produce the same hypertrophic effects, even when they are stimulating for the muscle.Differences between stimulating reps can arise when the active or passive elements of a muscle fiber contribute proportionally more or less to the overall force that is exerted. The active elements of a muscle fiber are the contractile parts, which produce force when the central nervous system sends a signal to the motor unit that controls it. The passive elements of muscle fiber are the elastic parts, which are stretched when the fiber is lengthened.For example, exercises can be performed as a lifting (concentric) only variation, or a lowering (eccentric) only variation, and they can be performed through different full or partial ranges of motion. In each case, the exercise can be performed so that it produces the same number of stimulating reps, but the effect on the type muscle growth will differ, although the overall change in muscle volume seems to be similar.When we perform an exercise as a lifting (concentric) only variation, or through a partial range of motion, the mechanical tension inside the muscle fibers is experienced primarily by the active (contractile) elements. This seems to trigger hypertrophy through increases in muscle fiber diameter. When do an exercise as a lowering (eccentric) only variation, or through a full range of motion, the mechanical tension inside the muscle fibers is experienced by both passive (elastic) and active (contractile) elements. This seems to trigger hypertrophy through increases in muscle fiber length.In the same way, exercises with different strength curves display different forces when the muscles are in lengthened and shortened positions, and this affects how much force is produced by either the passive (elastic) or active (contractile) elements. Exercises with flat, bell-shaped, or linear descending strength curves will place comparatively little load on the passive elements, while exercises with linear ascending strength curves will place a much greater load on the passive elements.How can exercise strength curves affect hypertrophy? (stretch-mediated hypertrophy)When we alter the contribution of the active and passive elements to muscle force, the main effect is on the type of muscle fiber growth. When the active elements are predominantly stimulated, the muscle fiber increases in diameter, but when the passive elements are predominantly stimulated, the muscle fiber increases in length.However, in some cases, reaching a more stretched position in an exercise, and thereby loading the passive elements to a greater extent, also causes greater total hypertrophy, and not just greater increases in fiber length.This is called \u201cstretch-mediated hypertrophy.\u201dStretch-mediated hypertrophy seems to happen when the muscle is working predominantly on the descending limb of the length-tension relationship in the exercise, such that the passive elements contribute substantially to total force production for the majority of the lift.We cannot assume that stretch-mediated hypertrophy will always occur, regardless of the muscle being trained. Its effects seem to be limited to those muscles that display specific length-tension relationships.Since exercises with different strength curves display different forces when the muscles are in lengthened and shortened positions, we can use strength curves to trigger stretch-mediated hypertrophy in those muscles that are responsive to it. Exercises with flat, bell-shaped, or linear descending strength curves are not suitable, since they place comparatively little load on the passive elements, but exercises with linear ascending strength curves are likely to be quite effective, because they place a much greater load on the passive elements.How can exercise strength curves affect hypertrophy? (regional hypertrophy)We tend to think of muscles as fairly uniform objects that contract in the same way regardless of the direction of force, or the joint angle at which force is produced.In fact, muscles are often made up of multiple regions, which each function somewhat independently of one another. This subdivision of a muscle into regions probably happens arises due to differences in the leverage that each region of the muscle has on the joint when moving it in different directions, or at different joint angles. The variety in other aspects of muscle regions, such as architecture and fiber type, are probably features that arise subsequently to this original factor.Consequently, exercises tend to stimulate more muscle growth in one region than another. This may occur for a number of reasons, but is most likely to happen because of differences in the activation of the muscle from one joint angle to another, and the subsequently greater deformations of the fibers in one region compared to in others.Regional muscle growth differs between lifting (concentric) only and eccentric (only) strength training, between exercises that involve larger and smaller ranges of motion, and it also differs between exercises that display different strength curves by using either constant loads or accommodating resistance.How can exercise strength curves affect hypertrophy? (proportional muscle contribution)When there is more than one muscle acting at a joint, the effects of the exercise strength curve become more complicated, because their relative internal moment arm lengths determine which of the muscles contributes the most force at any given joint angle.For example, at the hip joint, the hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and adductor magnus are all prime movers that contribute to the hip extension torque. However, their internal moment arms change with joint angle, and in different ways.The internal moment arm length of the gluteus maximus increases as the hip approaches full extension, the internal moment arm length of the adductor magnus increases as the hip flexes, and the internal moment arm length of the hamstrings displays a shallow, bell-shaped curve. This means that when the squat is performed with a partial range of motion, the gluteus maximus is a larger contributor to hip extension torque, but when the squat is performed with a full range of motion, the adductor magnus contributes to a greater extent. We might therefore expect the same effects from altering the strength curve in the squat. The adductor magnus should be more active when conventional free weights are used, but the gluteus maximus should be more active when accommodating resistance is added.Indeed, we already know that switching between constant load weights and accommodating resistance during knee extension training causes a shift in the amount of hypertrophy that occurs in the two-joint rectus femoris, but not in the single-joint quadriceps.What does this mean in practice?Strength curves are complex, so it is important to figure out simple guidelines to inform strength training practice when training for maximum increases in muscle size. As set out above, there are (at least) four ways in which the strength curve of an exercise can affect the resulting muscle growth that occurs after a workout, as follows:Proportional contribution of the active and passive elements \u2014 exercises with linear ascending strength curves (like the barbell squat) likely to load the passive elements more than exercises with flat, bell-shaped, or linear descending strength curves. Such exercises will involve proportionally greater increases in fiber length than in fiber diameter, relative to exercises with other strength curves, which will likely affect the resulting changes in shape of the muscles.Stretch-mediated hypertrophy \u2014 exercises with linear ascending strength curves (like the barbell squat) likely to load the passive elements more than exercises with flat, bell-shaped, or linear descending strength curves. For some muscles that operate primarily on the descending limb of the length-tension curve, this can cause stretch-mediated hypertrophy, which will lead to greater overall increases in muscle volume compared to other strength curves.Regional muscle growth \u2014 exercises with different strength curves will likely produce different amounts of muscle growth in each functional subdivision or region of a muscle.Proportional involvement of muscles \u2014 exercises with different strength curves will likely produce different amounts of muscle growth in each muscle that acts as a prime mover at a joint, because of variations in the internal moment arm lengths with joint angle.In practice, this means that where a muscle is operating primarily on the descending limb of the length-tension relationship (like the quadriceps), selecting an exercise that has a linear ascending strength curve (like the barbell squat) is probably going to be slightly more effective for overall hypertrophy than an exercise with a different strength curve.Additionally, it means that a variety of exercises, with different strength curves, are likely optimal for maximum muscle growth, as each exercise (and each strength curve) will produce a different stimulus, either because of their different effects on fiber length or fiber diameter, their different effects on each region of a muscle, or their different effects on the various prime mover muscles at a joint.What is the takeaway?Exercise strength curves describe the way in which the difficulty of a movement changes over its range of motion. Strength curves can be flat, such that the exercise is similarly difficult over the whole range of motion, or varying, such that the exercise is more difficult at one point than at others.An exercise strength curve is determined by way in which our capacity for producing force changes across the joint angles used in an exercise, and the way that the requirement for force production changes over the exercise range of motion. This means that both internal (relating to the body) and external (relating to the exercise) factors affect the effects of a strength curve.Strength curves affect hypertrophy because they (1) alter the proportional contribution of the active and passive elements, (2) affect how much stretch-mediated hypertrophy can occur in susceptible muscles, (3) determine which region of a muscle is most stimulated by an exercise, and (4) alter the proportional involvement of each muscle at a joint. Overall, this suggests that a variety of exercise strength curves are optimal for maximum muscle growth.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Fitness", "Bodybuilding", "Muscle Building", "Strength Training", "Hypertrophy"]}, {"title": "Understanding Hyperparameters and its Optimisation techniques", "post_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-hyperparameters-and-its-optimisation-techniques-f0debba07568?source=search_post", "author_name": "Prabhu", "author_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/@RaghavPrabhu", "publish_date": "2018-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-03", "readtime": "4.35", "claps": 223, "voters": 48, "content": "Figure 1: https://pixabay.com/en/thoughts-think-psyche-psychology-551263/Understanding Hyperparameters and its Optimisation techniquesPrabhuFollowJul 3, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWhat are Hyperparameters?In statistics, hyperparameter is a parameter from a prior distribution; it captures the prior belief before data is observed.In any machine learning algorithm, these parameters need to be initialized before training a model.Model parameters vs HyperparametersModel parameters are the properties of training data that will learn on its own during training by the classifier or other ML model. For example,Weights and BiasesSplit points in Decision TreeFigure 2: Hyperparameters vs model parameters \u2192 SourceModel Hyperparameters are the properties that govern the entire training process. The below are the variables usually configure before training a model.Learning RateNumber of EpochsHidden LayersHidden UnitsActivations FunctionsWhy are Hyperparameters essential?Hyperparameters are important because they directly control the behaviour of the training algorithm and have a significant impact on the performance of the model is being trained.\u201cA good choice of hyperparameters can really make an algorithm shine\u201d.Choosing appropriate hyperparameters plays a crucial role in the success of our neural network architecture. Since it makes a huge impact on the learned model. For example, if the learning rate is too low, the model will miss the important patterns in the data. If it is high, it may have collisions.Choosing good hyperparameters gives two benefits:Efficiently search the space of possible hyperparametersEasy to manage a large set of experiments for hyperparameter tuning.Hyperparameters Optimisation TechniquesThe process of finding most optimal hyperparameters in machine learning is called hyperparameter optimisation.Common algorithms include:Grid SearchRandom SearchBayesian OptimisationGrid SearchGrid search is a very traditional technique for implementing hyperparameters. It brute force all combinations. Grid search requires to create two set of hyperparameters.Learning RateNumber of LayersGrid search trains the algorithm for all combinations by using the two set of hyperparameters (learning rate and number of layers) and measures the performance using \u201cCross Validation\u201d technique. This validation technique gives assurance that our trained model got most of the patterns from the dataset. One of the best methods to do validation by using \u201cK-Fold Cross Validation\u201d which helps to provide ample data for training the model and ample data for validations.Figure 3: Grid Search \u2192 SourceThe Grid search method is a simpler algorithm to use but it suffers if data have high dimensional space called the curse of dimensionality.Random SearchRandomly samples the search space and evaluates sets from a specified probability distribution. For example, Instead of trying to check all 100,000 samples, we can check 1000 random parameters.Figure 4: Random Search \u2192 SourceThe drawback of using the random search algorithm, however, it doesn\u2019t use information from prior experiments to select the next set and also it is very difficult to predict the next of experiments.Bayesian OptimisationHyperparameter setting maximizes the performance of the model on a validation set. Machine learning algorithms frequently require to fine-tuning of model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, that tuning is often called as \u2018black function\u2019 because it cannot be written into a formula since the derivates of the function are unknown.Much more appealing way to optimize and fine-tune hyperparameters are enabling automated model tuning approach by using Bayesian optimization algorithm. The model used for approximating the objective function is called surrogate model. A popular surrogate model for Bayesian optimization is Gaussian process (GP). Bayesian optimization typically works by assuming the unknown function was sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) and maintains a posterior distribution for this function as observations are made.There are two major choices must be made when performing Bayesian optimization.Select prior over functions that will express assumptions about the function being optimized. For this, we choose Gaussian Process priorNext, we must choose an acquisition function which is used to construct a utility function from the model posterior, allowing us to determine the next point to evaluate.Gaussian ProcessA Gaussian process defines the prior distribution over functions which can be converted into a posterior over functions once we have seen some data. The Gaussian process uses Covariance matrix to ensure that values that are close together. The covariance matrix along with a mean \u00b5 function to output the expected value \u0192(x) defines a Gaussian process.1. Gaussian process will be used as a prior for Bayesian inference2. To computing the posterior is that it can be used to make predictions for unseen test cases.Figure 5: Gaussian Process prior distribution \u2192 SourceFigure 6: Gaussian Process posterior distribution by applying covariance matrix \u2192 SourceAcquisition FunctionIntroducing sampling data into the search space is done by acquisition functions. It helps to maximize the acquisition function to determine the next sampling point. Popular acquisition functions areMaximum Probability of Improvement (MPI)Expected Improvement (EI)Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)The Expected Improvement (EI) function seems to be a popular one. It is defined asEI(x)=\ud835\udd3c[max{0,\u0192(x)\u2212\u0192(x\u0302 )}]where \u0192(x\u0302 ) is the current optimal set of hyperparameters. Maximising the hyperparameters will improve upon \u0192.EI is high when the posterior expected value of the loss \u00b5(x) is higher than the current best value \u0192(x\u0302)EI is high when the uncertainty \u03c3(x)\u03c3(x) around the point xx is high.Summary:Hyperparameter tuning is an art as we often call as \u201cblack function\u201d.

In the first post we discussed whether and where in Life Sciences we have Big Data suitable for Machine / Deep Learning, and emphasized that Single Cell is one of the most promising Big Data resources. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) is a Machine Learning non-linear dimensionality reduction technique which is absolutely central for Single Cell data analysis. However, the choice of hyperparameters for the tSNE might be confusing for beginners.In this post, I will share my recommendations on selecting optimal values of hyperparameters such as perplexity, number of principal components to keep, and number of iterations for running tSNE.How to Use tSNE EffectivelyWhen teaching single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) course I keep getting questions about sensitivity of tSNE with respect to hyperparameters such as perplexity. The questions are usually inspired by this fantastic post about challenges with interpreting tSNE plots.A popular tutorial on developing intuition behind tSNEDespite my great respect for the main message of the post, I think scRNAseq community should not worry too much about perplexity and other tSNE hyperparameters based on what they learn from that post because: a) many examples in the post come from abstract mathematical topologies which do not really resemble scRNAseq data, b) the post concentrates on extreme tSNE hyperparameters which are rarely used in the real world scRNAseq analysis.If you do scRNAseq analysis you will not avoid the popular Rtsne function and R package which is based on Barnes-Hut C++ implementation of the original tSNE algorithm. The Rtsne function has three main hyperparameters:initial_dims (default 50) providing that pca=TRUEperplexity (default 30)max_iter (default 1000)Here, we will go through these hyperparameters and explain what they mean. Obviously, their default values might not work well for arbitrary data. Here, I am going to explain how to select optimal tSNE hyperparameters for your particular data set if you are not sure where to start.How to select optimal number of PCs?scRNAseq is a high-dimensional data (~20 000 dimensions / genes) while tSNE has difficulty dealing with high dimensions. Therefore, typically you want to reduce initial number of dimensions linearly with e.g. PCA or non-linearly with e.g. Autoencoder (see e.g. here) down to 30 - 50 latent variables (initial_dims) and use this as a new data set for feeding into tSNE. Here for simplicity we will use PCA for the pre-dimensionality reduction since PCA is great at separating signal from noise. Let us plot the percentage of variance explained by Principal Components (PCs) using scRNAseq data from Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs):Looks familiar, doesn\u2019t it? However, how many Principal Components (PCs) should we keep for inputting into tSNE, i.e. what value initial_dims should take: 20, 30, 50 or maybe more? Here we have a dilemma: 1) if we select too many PCs, we will include \u201cnoisy\u201d PCs from the tail of the plot, however 2) if we select too few PCs we might loose the signal from the data. To make this decision we recall that randomization is a friend of a Data Scientist and will compare the observed variance explained by PCs with permuted variance. For this purpose, we shuffle the elements of the expression matrix, perform PCA and check what would the above plot look like for the permuted matrix:The red curve on the first plot is the mean of the permuted variance explained by PCs, this can be treated as a \u201cnoise zone\u201d. In other words, the point where the observed variance (green curve) hits the permuted variance (red curve) determines how many informative PCs we have in our data. Moreover, since we have a vector of permuted variances, it is possible to calculate the p-value of how the observed variance is different from the permuted variance for each PC. For the case of CAFs we conclude that 30 PCs should be kept for the tSNE and the rest should be ignored as their values fall into the \u201cnoise zone\u201d.How to select optimal perplexity?Perplexity is perhaps the most confusing hyperparameter of tSNE. The author of tSNE, Laurens van der Maaten, mentions in the FAQ: Typical values for the perplexity range between 5 and 50. One obvious questions that comes immediately to my mind: \u201cFor how many data points? What if I have 10 000 cells, should I still use perplexity in the range between 5 and 50?\u201d. In the next sentence of the FAQ Laurens van der Maaten adds:Loosely speaking, one could say that a larger / denser data set requires a larger perplexityThis sounds reasonable but what should be the functional form of perplexity vs. number of cells in order to capture both local and global data structures? To answer this question, one year ago I collected 43 scRNAseq data sets which were publicly available at that time, many of them were downloaded from here. Valentine Svensson has another comprehensive and much more updated list of 500 scRNAseq data sets. For each of the 43 data sets I made a few tSNE plots with perplexities varying from 3 to N/3 (default max perplexity in Rtsne function), N is the number of cells. For the CAFs data set this looked like this:Next, I went through the plots in order to select a range of perplexities where clustering looked most transparent to me, and plotted the mean value of this range of perplexities vs. number of cells for each data set. The curves for the normal (above) and the log-scale (below) looked as follows:The dependence on the log-scale looks linear, fitting linear model I obtained log(Perp) = -0.179 + 0.51*log(N). Please note the coefficient 1/2 in front of log(N), this implies that the perplexity grows as Perp ~ N^(1/2). Later I realized that this power law is very similar to the rule of thumb for selecting optimal K in the K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Indeed, in the KNN Machine Learning it is widely accepted (see for example here) that optimal K~N^(1/2). Since the intuition behind perplexity is how many neighbors each data point can \u201csense\u201d, this confirms the power law obtained above.Now let us try to analytically derive this power law. Since tSNE is based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, so maybe the optimal perplexity can be found from the minimum of KL? However, if we plot KL as a function of perplexity at other parameters fixed, it decreases monotonically.So there is no minimum of KL with respect to perplexity, and KL will always prefer higher perplexities despite we know that too large perplexities will lead to one big clump of points without any clustering. Therefore we need to build another Score function that includes the KL and an additional contribution that penalizes KL for too large perplexities. Assuming that the KL behaves as 1/Perplexity, a simple function which always has a minimum would be Score ~ 1/Perplexity + Perplexity. However, Perplexity is usually a large number, therefore the Score function will be dominated by the second term. A simple trick to make both contributions to be on the same order of magnitude is to normalize the second term by the number of cells N. Finally, in order to find the minimum of Score we calculate its derivative with respect to Perplexity and equate it to zero. Solving this equation leads to Perplexity ~ N^(1/2).Simple scaling derivation of the power law Perplexity ~ N^(1/2)Despite the empirical way of deriving the power law, Perplexity ~ N^(1/2), can not be considered as a proper research, it helps developing an intuition about the concept of perplexity and its relation to the number of cells. On the other hand, many things about tSNE are based on pure intuition and rules of thumb as tSNE does not have a solid mathematical background in contrast to UMAP. Therefore if you are not sure what perplexity to use for your particular data set, try N^(1/2) and you will not be too off.How to select optimal number of iterations?When it comes to the number of iterations needed for tSNE to converge, the simplest recommendation can be the more iterations the better. However, practically this is not feasible for big data sets as one might have to wait for days to reach e.g. 10 000 iterations. In contrast, if you use too few iterations the clusters might not be visible and you typically discover a huge clump of data points in the center of your tSNE plot. What to do in this case? Well, if you look carefully at the tSNE plots available in literature, you notice that the largest distance between data points is on the order of ~100. This simple rule of thumb indicates that the algorithm reached convergence and further increasing the number of iterations will only marginally change the plot. For the CAFs data set, we can observe how the scale spans only a few units at the beginning of the training and grows up to ~60 units for larger numbers of iterations such as max_iter = 1000, this also leads to more distinct clustering.Changes in tSNE plot when increasing the number of iterationsSummaryIn this post we have learnt that despite tSNE can be sensitive with respect to its hyperparameters, there are simple rules for obtaining good looking tSNE plots for scRNAseq data. The optimal number of PCs for inputting into tSNE can be found through randomization of the expression matrix. The optimal perplexity can be calculated from the number of cells according to the simple power law Perplexity ~ N^(1/2). Finally, the optimal number of iterations should provide the largest distance between the data points of ~100 units.In the comments below let me know which analyses in Life Sciences seem especially mysterious to you and I will try to address them in this column.

It means writing is happening. Logic is being deduced, dots connected. In some ways, it\u2019s what I hope for every time I sit down to write, the mad excitement of tapping into the reserves of words and ideas that dwell in the hard-to-reach places of my psyche.

Code that is difficult to test, duplicated code or little to none separation are things that give me headache nearly everyday.Patterns try to solve common problems for certain use-cases. Singleton is a simple example. It solves the problem that a class just has to have one state.The difference between design patterns (like the singleton) and architectural patterns is that architectural patterns solve problems relating with the separation of concerns.The ProblemWe create amazing apps. And with amazing apps, amazing user interfaces and complex functionality. That means our features will get complex as they grow.We have to think about how we get everything clear, extensible, maintable and understandable.The solutionVIPER solves exactly this problem: It describes the responsibility of our parts and how they interact with each other.I refactored my App PursCreate to VIPER and started using it in some other larger projects. And this is what I learned:Everything has it\u2018s specific place. You know exactly that a functionality musst be placed in the router or presenter for example.The structure got more complex but it\u2018s super easy to add new features and keep them decoupled from anotherI reduced side effectsIt was easier to write UnitTests for my business logicLet me give a short description of the parts of VIPER:ViewWhen you launch your App the things you see is the view. It\u2018s that red button with corner radius and shadow or some gradient-colored pills.PresenterThe presentation logic handles all actions that are needed in order to display all required information in the view (asks the Interactor for the data).It also handles all user-interaction like present a new screen, visually enter the edit mode or a custom back-action.InteractorThe Interactor contains the business logic or acts as a facade to it.In my recent projects common use cases were CoreData access, filtering products in a product-list (shopping app) or fire HTTP-Requests.EntityEntities represent your DataModel. This might be a ManagedObjectModel (for CoreData) or a structure containing a HTTP-response.RouterThe Router handles all the display and navigation logic. For example when a user clicks a button:The presenter will call the router and say: displayMyView().Why should I extract this simple logic?Because it quickly grows.In my App PursCreate I have the following case:When you click on a cell, an overview of your goal appears. There are two goal types. So you have to determine wether it\u2018s a classic task or a streak.Now the user can edit his goals. If he enters the edit mode you have to determine the types again but in this time open the edit for the corresponding task and not the overview.When an app grows this part might get very complex.ComplexityVIPER has many advantages. However it comes with a lot of complexity. This might result in unnecessary overengineering.HelloWorld OverengineeredOur job as programmer is to decide which architectural pattern is the right one for our use case. Maybe MVC or MVVM is perfect for simple use cases. In more complex things VIPER benefits with its separation and scalability.This article describes it perfectly.

Resumidamente, Clean Architecture divide a l\u00f3gica da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em camadas distintas de responsabilidade com o intuito de facilitar e testar as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre as camadas. J\u00e1 a palavra VIPER \u00e9 um acr\u00f4nimo para View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity e Model, os quais ser\u00e3o destrinchados mais \u00e0 frente.No desenvolvimento de aplica\u00e7\u00f5es para iOS, a arquitetura mais utilizada \u00e9 a famosa MVC (Model-View-Controller), enquanto no Android variamos entre o MVP (Model-View-Presenter) e MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). Em ambos os casos, temos o problema de toda a l\u00f3gica de neg\u00f3cio estar concentrado em uma classe, inflando-a e dificultando a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e a inclus\u00e3o de novas funcionalidades da mesma.Mesmo o VIPER sendo inicialmente idealizado para estruturar projetos da plataforma iOS, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel trazer seu conceito para o Android.Figura 01. Modelo da arquitetura VIPERView: Respons\u00e1vel por exibir os dados processados pelo Presenter e enviar os inputs do usu\u00e1rio para o Presenter;Interactor: Respons\u00e1vel pela l\u00f3gica do neg\u00f3cio de acordo com o caso de uso (Ex: trazer uma lista de usu\u00e1rios de forma ascendente utilizando o nome como \u00e2ncora);Presenter: Respons\u00e1vel pela l\u00f3gica da View, ou seja, prepara o conte\u00fado que deve ser exibido (conte\u00fado oriundo do Interactor) e reage aos inputs do usu\u00e1rio (normalmente requisitando novos dados para o Interactor);Entity: Cont\u00e9m as classes modelos que s\u00e3o utilizadas pelo Interactor;Router: Respons\u00e1vel pela l\u00f3gica de navega\u00e7\u00e3o, ou seja, qual tela dever\u00e1 ser mostrada e a ordem de empilhamento da mesma.Aplicando o VIPER no projetoE como podemos construir nosso projeto atrav\u00e9s do VIPER? Para exemplificar de forma simples a arquitetura, vamos criar um projeto de j\u00e1-ken-p\u00f4. Para quem n\u00e3o conhece, o jogo \u00e9 basicamente composto por tr\u00eas elementos: pedra, papel e tesoura, onde a pedra derrota a tesoura, esta, por sua vez, derrota o papel e este derrota a pedra. Para estruturar o projeto, vamos criar os pacotes que ser\u00e3o utilizados para organizar os m\u00f3dulos.Figura 02. Estrutura padr\u00e3o de pacotesPrimeiramente, vamos criar um enum para definir as op\u00e7\u00f5es de entrada poss\u00edveis do usu\u00e1rio. Nesse caso, teremos Rock, Scissors and Paper.Figura 03. Entity para estabelecer os tipos de entrada poss\u00edveis do usu\u00e1rioCriando as assinaturasA interface do Router, a qual chamaremos JaKenPoRouter e que ser\u00e1 respons\u00e1vel por encaminhar o usu\u00e1rio para a tela de feedback com este podendo variar entre sucesso (status = 1), empate (status = 0) e derrota (status = -1).Figura 04. Interface JaKenPoRouterA interface do Interactor ir\u00e1 conter a assinatura para o m\u00e9todo com a l\u00f3gica de neg\u00f3cio da classe principal, ou seja, ser\u00e1 respons\u00e1vel por verificar se o usu\u00e1rio venceu, empatou ou perdeu a partida.Figura 05. Interface JaKenPoInteractorComo o Presenter \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pela l\u00f3gica de inputs oriundos da View, sua interface dever\u00e1 conter a assinatura dos m\u00e9todos que ser\u00e3o chamados por esses inputs. O Presenter tamb\u00e9m ir\u00e1 receber e tratar o retorno do Interactor.Figura 06. Interface JaKenPoPresenterPor \u00faltimo, temos a interface da nossa View. Por ser um aplicativo sem atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o da View, iremos criar apenas uma assinatura de m\u00e9todo para atribuir um listener aos bot\u00f5es.Figura 07. Interface JaKenPoViewEstas assinaturas comp\u00f5em apenas a parte inicial do projeto. Ainda temos a tela de feedback ao usu\u00e1rio, mas que n\u00e3o irei apontar detalhadamente no artigo. Para mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es, basta acessar o reposit\u00f3rio no GitHub.Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o das classesUma das facilidades do Kotlin em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Java \u00e9 a possibilidade de criar Extensions para as classes, como por exemplo: Activity, Context, etc, sem precisar sobreescrever todos os m\u00e9todos da classe. Vamos ent\u00e3o criar uma extens\u00e3o da classe Activity que ir\u00e1 iniciar uma nova Intent j\u00e1 aplicando o par\u00e2metro que ser\u00e1 utilizado para definir o tipo de feedback que ser\u00e1 dado ao usu\u00e1rio na pr\u00f3xima Activity.Figura 08. Extens\u00e3o para iniciar nova ActivityCom a extens\u00e3o criada, \u00e9 a hora de codificarmos nossa classe Router. Importante lembrar que ela dever\u00e1 implementar a interface JaKenPoRouter. Pelo construtor passamos uma refer\u00eancia de Activity que dever\u00e1 poder ser nula, pois devemos anul\u00e1-la quando a Activity for destru\u00edda a fim de evitar NPE.Figura 09. Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da classe RouterNa classe Interactor iremos codificar nossa regra de neg\u00f3cio. A implementa\u00e7\u00e3o consiste basicamente em criar um valor rand\u00f4mico para o oponente e fazer o depara com o valor escolhido pelo usu\u00e1rio. Assim, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel definir se o usu\u00e1rio venceu, empatou ou perdeu. Contudo, para retornar o resultado da l\u00f3gica de neg\u00f3cio, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio uma refer\u00eancia do Presenter, o qual ser\u00e1 enviado pelo construtor da classe Interactor.Figura 10. Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da classe InteractorFigura 11. Business logicEnt\u00e3o chegamos a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do nosso Presenter. Nele iremos conectar as layers View \u2014 Interactor \u2014 Router.Figura 12. Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da classe PresenterFinalmente, a classe View. Nela iremos inflar o layout contendo tr\u00eas bot\u00f5es que representam os valores de Pedra, Papel e Tesoura, criaremos uma inst\u00e2ncia do Presenter e inicializaremos os listeners dos bot\u00f5es.Figura 13. Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da classe ViewVantagens\u00b7 O VIPER \u00e9 uma tentativa de aplicar os princ\u00edpios do SOLID (Single responsability|Open/closed|Liskov substitution|Interface Segregation|Dependency inversion) primeiramente na plataforma iOS, mas vimos como \u00e9 poss\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m aplica-la ao Android.\u00b7 Projeto altamente preparado para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de testes, pois como os m\u00f3dulos s\u00e3o soltos, \u00e9 muito f\u00e1cil test\u00e1-los separadamente. Cada objeto dentro do m\u00f3dulo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem separado, o que \u00e9 \u00f3timo para testes unit\u00e1rios. Aplicando o VIPER no projeto, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel alcan\u00e7ar facilmente 80\u201390% de cobertura de testes, valor que \u00e9 muito mais dif\u00edcil de alcan\u00e7ar utilizando MVVM e MVP, ou no caso do iOS, MVC.\u00b7 Como os m\u00f3dulos s\u00e3o independentes, o VIPER \u00e9 realmente bom para equipes grandes (tr\u00eas ou mais desenvolvedores). Isso significa menos conflitos de mesclagem, melhor testabilidade e altera\u00e7\u00f5es mais f\u00e1ceis de m\u00f3dulos. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel criar primeiramente o esqueleto da arquitetura inicial, e em seguida, fornecer m\u00f3dulos um por um a outros desenvolvedores para implementar a l\u00f3gica.\u00b7 Os arquivos s\u00e3o menores, em geral, n\u00e3o mais do que 3k de linhas de c\u00f3digo, facilitando a leitura e o entendimento da l\u00f3gica.Desvantagens\u00b7 Pouca ou quase nenhuma documenta\u00e7\u00e3o, manual de boas pr\u00e1ticas ou comunidades quase inexistentes. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel encontrar um ou outro bom artigo pesquisando bastante na internet, o que me faz supor a falta de popularidade do VIPER.\u00b7 At\u00e9 se familiarizar com o VIPER, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio dispender alguns dias de estudo aprendendo o b\u00e1sico e depois algumas semanas at\u00e9 estar bem familiarizado, mas \u00e9 um desafio que vale a pena enfrentar.\u00b7 Com o tempo, voc\u00ea talvez note algumas falhas na arquitetura VIPER: m\u00f3dulos que n\u00e3o necessitam de View, Presenters sem uso, Interactors sem chamadas, etc.\u00b7 Para iOS, desenvolvedores criaram um gerador de c\u00f3digo automatizado conhecido como Generamba, o qual ir\u00e1 ajudar na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de arquivos, protocolos e fun\u00e7\u00f5es compartilhadas. Para Android, n\u00e3o encontrei nada parecido.Conclus\u00e3oInicialmente, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do VIPER atrasou o desenvolvimento do projeto, mas \u00e0 medida que a familiaridade com a arquitetura aumentou, tornou-se mais simples e at\u00e9 mais eficiente o desenvolvimento do projeto. Atualmente, tenho a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de manter o VIPER como minha arquitetura de desenvolvimento padr\u00e3o, pois suas vantagens suplantam (e muito!) suas desvantagens. Caso tenha tempo e vontade, arrisque aprender tamb\u00e9m. Se n\u00e3o gostar, pelo menos ter\u00e1 mais um padr\u00e3o de arquitetura em sua base de conhecimentos.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Kotlin", "Architectural Design", "Viper", "Android"]}, {"title": "Hello vapers, again :)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/vapingdb/hello-world-again-31e03a323e5d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bonesoul", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bonesoul", "publish_date": "2018-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-23", "readtime": "4.88", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Hello vapers, again :)BonesoulFollowApr 22, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readI\u2019m proud to announce VapingDB \u2014 https://vapingdb.com, the next vaping database site for you vapers out there!Before continuing on the story behind VapingDB, let me introduce it first.Basically, VapingDB is an all-in-one database featuring juice, mod, atomizers reviews and DIY recipes.Have your ever found yourself searching for reviews of a specific juice, atomizer or mod? If your answer is \u2018yes\u2019, you are on the same track with me \u2014 which is the reason at first I started working it.Yes I\u2019m aware of the great vaping review channels like DJLsb, Mike vapes, GrimmGreen, VapingwithTwisted420, pbusardo, IndoorSmokers, The Vaping Bogan and others \u2014 and I want to thank them all for their great work.Still personally I think that we also need \u2018user reviews\u2019 as complementary to those. For juices part, JuiceDB has been serving this very well (great work guys!) but for the hardware part, I always thought we lacked one.So approximately I started working on VapingDB 2 years ago with these ideas in mind.And as of today VapingDB consists of 3 major sections; juice & hardware reviews and DIY recipes sections.Juice reviewsSimilar to JuiceDB, you can review your favorite juices and favorite them or add them to your wishlist.Hardware reviewsAdditionally it does have the same functionality for vaping gear, like mods, atomizers and so.DIY mixer toolYet again it does also have DIY mixer tool where you can save your favorite recipes or search for new ones.In the rest of the post, I\u2019ll be detailing actual story behind the site.The storyI have been working on the site for last 2 years :) and I can easily say it worth the effort.Code contribution historyAs you can see from the above graph, it all started in March 2016. Back in that time I had just started vaping with a group friends and we were sharing our ideas about juices, mods and atomizers in our Discord group.The idea emerged in that days that we need some kind of platform that we could share our experiences and as of late March I had already started working on the idea.The infamous initial commit :)Back at those days the project\u2019s name was \u2018Buharmetre\u2019 (meaning \u201csteam-meter\u201d) as it was targeted just for Turkish vaping community.Fast-forward a week, I had very primitive version and mentioned about it to my friends.The early release historyAfter a few months of iterations, I had a usable version up and running. Thanks to word of mouth, it got some traction within the Turkish vaping community very quickly.October 2016 snapshot of Buharmetre.comYou can see a screenshot from October 2016 above \u2014 which the site was fully functional and was used by the community actively.New users were registering the site every new day and they were adding new reviews and it was getting bigger and bigger every day. Everything was going great..Fast forward to July 2017, the site had a big community at it\u2019s first birthday and we had plenty of user-created content at the day;591 juice entries, 482 reviews.131 hardware entries, 71 reviews.60 DIY recipes.854 users.Meanwhile I had meet new friends from the local Turkish vaping community that had other sites and youtube review channels.One day, I received a message from one of those friends that he had to close his channel because that there were rumors of local authorities would soon start taking legal actions to vaping sites & channels.In a few days, every major channel & community had to close it\u2019s doors because the rumors started happening. And sadly this was the end of story for Buharmetre.com too. With a heavy hearth, I had to plug out the site.I never expected this to happen, instead I was expecting legalization vaping. But it did not. It was really a depressing period for me \u2014 as all my efforts had gone in a day.So for following 3 months, I tried out to find solution but eventually it was quite clear that I would be never able to re-open the \u2018Buharmetre\u2019 in any foreseeable future.The VapingDBWith all my efforts gone in day, I decided to start a new site \u2014 this time an international one. I had all the base work & code available for so.So at first, I needed a domain. It had be self-explaining; as the site was going to be a database for vapers, \u2018vaping \u2014 db\u2019 was a perfect match.I registered the domain and started working immediately. First of all I had to work on the site\u2019s language and it eventually took some time. Meanwhile, it was also a great time to rework the site\u2019s user-interface \u2014 a clean one \u2014 as I was not very keen on the old one.All these changes and improvements on the backend & frontend code took 6 months of hard work.TodayFinally, I\u2019m done with all the planned changes and decided to start the site\u2019s engines again :)As the site is now basically feature-complete, I decided to shout it out to vaping world \u2014with the hope of getting the same traction like it\u2019s ancestor \u2018Buharmetre\u2019.Our new vaping database; https://vapingdb.comI\u2019d like to note that VapingDB is just a way for me paying the community back!The futureThe milestonesOne thing is clear, I\u2019ve a very crowded TODO list! Though as I do work on the code-base fixing \u2018long awaiting\u2019 bugs, cooking improvements, hopefully it\u2019ll not take much time to finish all those awaiting stuff.Meanwhile, I do have plans for these upcoming features;Business ratings.Flavor stash.Copy recipe support.Being able to select juice for DIY recipes.Deals support.More vaping tools!That\u2019s all for now guys, keep tuned!Word of mouth!If you liked the idea, I\u2019m looking for your help guys and as you know word of mouth is the best way!", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "VAPERROR //  D \u29bf T \u0392 A \u2020", "post_link": "https://medium.com/launched-eps/vaperror-d-t-a-4b762a2d4d0c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vertigem", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vertigem", "publish_date": "2014-07-15", "last_modified_date": "2014-07-15", "readtime": "0.37", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "VAPERROR //  D \u29bf T \u0392 A \u2020vaporwave // chillwave // experimental hiphopVertigemFollowJul 15, 2014 \u00b7 1 min readVAPERROR is an vaporwave project from Atlanta (GA) produced by Jeff C.

Adhere to these tips, make them habits, and you may be better off than you would be if you ignored this advice.#1 \u2014 Keep Your Vape ChargedThis is the first tip I offer: keep your vape fully charged. When your vape battery runs out of juice, you may find yourself looking for a cigarette instead of a charger. Avoid this scenario by always making a point to keep your vape or e-cig fully charged.#2 \u2014 Buy Spare BatteriesIf you haven\u2019t already, get a spare vape battery or two. This way, when you find the urge hit you- you\u2019re ready for it. Finding yourself in a situation where your battery is dead could otherwise lead you to buy or bum a cigarette, which is far from ideal for the vaper using vaping as a means by which to quit smoking.Don\u2019t just buy a spare battery or two- carry them with you. Make sure you always have them when you need them. And remember: batteries can explode so you\u2019re going to want to make a point to protect them and treat them right. If you\u2019re carrying them in a pocket, make sure they\u2019re enclosed in a proper protective case. And when you\u2019re charging them, always ensure that you\u2019re using the right charger. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more tips on how to properly store and charge your batteries on their website.#3 \u2014 Keep Your E-Liquid Supply Fully StockedHaving a fully charged vape battery is great and all but if you run out of e-juice, it\u2019s all for nothing. This is why I suggest making sure you\u2019re always stocked up on e-liquid. By doing so, you won\u2019t ever have to worry about what might happen (potential relapse) if you run dry.Another bit of advice here is to stock up on some different flavors. This way, you\u2019ll be able to avoid vaper\u2019s fatigue, which is what happens when you vape the same flavor day in and day out.#4 \u2014 Bring Your ChargerIn case you need it, it\u2019s wise to carry your charger on you at all times. Assuming you have spare batteries, this might not be necessary for all vapers but for those who often find that their batteries have run dry, it can make a world of difference.Take me for example. Just the other night I went out to dinner with a friend and realized that my batteries were dead. All of them. I didn\u2019t realize it until we were almost at the restaurant and so instead of turning back, I simply reached in my pocket and pulled out my charger. I took it inside, handed it to a waitress, and kindly asked her to charge my battery. She found an outlet nearby and plugged it right in. Easy as that.#5 \u2014 Never Leave Home Without ItWhen I first started vaping instead of smoking, I would occasionally forget to bring a vape with me when I ventured out. A number of times, due to my forgetfulness in this regard, I found myself bumming cigarettes off my friends. To avoid this scenario, make a habit of always bringing your vape with you wherever you go. This way, you\u2019ll never be without when you need it.Need spare vape batteries, e-liquid, or maybe a new e-cigarette altogether? Check out Vaper Empire\u2019s online vape store where you\u2019ll find a wide selection of quality e-liquids, vapes, and accessories \u2014 everything a vaper needs to keep the vapor flowing.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vaping", "Quit Smoking", "Vaping Tips", "Vape Life", "Electronic Cigarette"]}, {"title": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 19", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ekv%C3%A1dor-v%C3%BDprava-za-pivem/ekv%C3%A1dor-den-19-eb8c60f52c92?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zden\u00e1l F.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zdendaf", "publish_date": "2019-02-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-10", "readtime": "1.55", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 19St\u0159eda 6. \u00fanora\u200a\u2014\u200aZumbahua, CanoaZden\u00e1l F.FollowFeb 9 \u00b7 2 min readTerka u\u017e by za vegev\u00e1ly dala kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed.

A wide number of safe and effective treatments have come up for the reduction of skin pigmentation or dark spots. But are you aware of the exact causes of skin pigmentation? Daily habits contribute to being the key causes for similar skin issues.Here are 20 common things you need to avoid during pigmentation Treatment.CookingYou will be surprised to know that heat resulting from cooking is helpful for the prevention of pigmentation. People who have skin prone to heat should not go for cooking on higher frames. These people should not make use of sauna or steam room. Hot yoga is a big no for them.Bleaching skinBleaching the skin on a regular basis may result in skin pigmentation.Hair coloringColoring the hair can also result in pigmentation of the skin.Exposure to skinExposure to the skin may enhance the pigmentation of skin in absence of the prerequisite protection.Perfumed productsPerfumed products are highly preferred by people due to the good fragrance. This may cause skin pigmentation in case you have a sensitive or allergic skin. Hence, you should avoid similar products during pigmentation Treatment.FrictionFriction like rubbing the skin with the aid of nylon loofah may result in skin pigmentation.StressThe free radicals present in body enhance in number owing to stress which may lead to aggravation of pigmentation of skin and resulting in newer spots.SmokingIn addition to the exposure of body and skin to various toxic chemicals, smoking may result in reducing the number of antioxidants which count to be responsible for renewing the skin and keeping the same healthier. Both these factors may lead to pigmentation of the skin. Hence, you should say no to smoking during pigmentation Treatment.Hormonal imbalancesIn case the body comes with hormonal imbalances, one may suffer from skin pigmentation. It contributes to being the sign of underlying health conditions such as kidney and liver problems, insulin resistance, thyroid disorders, etc.TreatmentsIt is essential to select an effective skin pigmentation treatment irrespective of the causes for getting the same cured in a safer way. These treatments are recognized to be noninvasive. They are highly effective in the removal of freckles which are conditions that result from hyperpigmentation as well as melasma treatments.Benefits of skin pigmentation treatmentsAs you go for effective treatments for the reduction of skin treatments, it is possible to enjoy the following benefits:It is possible to correct the changes in the skin which are associated with aging such as blotchiness and age spots.The treatments are helpful in order to even out the skin tone irrespective of the skin type.It is possible to rectify changes in the skin which are associated with prolonged exposure to the sun such as sun spots.Stimulation of the production of collagen which aids in restoring the youthful appearance of skin.Treatment preparationA consultation is a prerequisite in order to assess the patient of skin and readiness for pigmentation treatments. The target areas require prepping and cleansing prior to the treatment.

Each block contains a hash of the previous block. Each block can contain one more many transactions.Instead of storing data in database directly, In blockchain it is saved in form of blocks and it creates a chain of blocks. This chain is IMMUTABLE ie. records can not be altered but append only.Blockchain NetworkBlockchain network is created by participants. Each participant is a single organisation. Each organisation can run their one or multiple nodes in network. There is no single owner of the network due to which network is decentralised. All participants can do transactions in a network. Each participant has a digital identity assigned to them by a valid CA. So any outside organisation or person can not get in network.Features of blockchainImmutable dataData stored in blockchain is immutable. It means data stored in blockchain can not be altered. Records can not be updated to their original state, they are append only. If there is any updation in a record then there will be a new record. A new block will be added for any write operation.Distributed LedgerA ledger is actual blockchain. In a blockchain network, every network participant will have the blockchain ledger. So ledger is not owned by a single organisation. Every network participant will have the ledger and everyone knows what\u2019s being added in ledger.SecurityAll data on the blockchain is cryptographically hashed. Hashing takes any input value and applies a mathematical algorithm to produce a new value of a fixed length.Change of hash will result in change the hash of all blocks, which is not easy.Digital identityEach network participant has the digital identity assigned by a valid certificate authority. So any unknown company or node can not participate in the network.ConsensusBlockchain works on consensus algorithm. Let\u2019s say if Org A wants to add some data into the blockchain then it needs to have approval to all the network participants. If all participants agree then only a write transaction will occur and a new block will be committed to the chain.Why should i move to blockchain ?All the features explained above gives you a strong reason to move into blockchain. But still would like to give a real world use case which can improve your understanding for blockchain.In the healthcare world, Let\u2019s say we are inserting a record of patient ( who is on medication) into a traditional database. The record can have below fieldsPatient NameMedicine NameMedicine QuantityDateDoctorDiseaseNow in traditional approach record will be inserted into database.Now Here problem is if someone has access to DB they can change the name or quantity of medicine easily and no one will be aware of it as record is changed directly into database. As this is a sensitive record this can lead to disaster situation for patients.How Blockchain comes to the rescue ?In blockchain this can\u2019t be done so easily. Even someone get access to blockchain but they can\u2019t change the data directly as data is saved in the form of blocks. Also, every network participant has the same blockchain data. So they can validate the data any time. And further write operation will not occur as data-set is mismatched between network participants. This way records saved in blockchain are much secure compared to traditional database.Thanks for reading.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Blockchain Development", "Hyperledger Fabric", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Blockchain Deployment Using Microservices with Kubernetes \u2014 XenonStack", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nishant8kaira/blockchain-deployment-using-microservices-with-kubernetes-xenonstack-7a3a08699d4c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nishant Kaira", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nishant8kaira", "publish_date": "2018-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2019-11-25", "readtime": "5.08", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Blockchain Deployment Using Microservices with Kubernetes \u2014 XenonStackNishant KairaFollowDec 26, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readThe BlockChain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. This technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. These blocks are added in chronological order. In order to deploy a blockchain application, you need a distributed Hyperledger blockchain on your choice of infrastructure (on-premise or cloud).In this article, we will deploy a Hyperledger Fabric cluster using Kubernetes.Prerequisites for BlockChain Application DeploymentTo follow this guide you need a system with a working Kubernetes cluster on it. We will use Fabric which is an implementation of blockchain technology written in Golang so go version go1.6.2 or above is required.Before proceeding further let\u2019s have a look at Hyperledger Fabric.The Hyperledger ProjectHyperledger is an open-source project with a collaborative effort created to advance blockchain technology. It helps in cross-industry distributed ledgers that support transaction systems, property transactions, and other services.Hyperledger FabricFabric is an implementation of blockchain technology. It provides a modular architecture allowing pluggable implementations of the various function.Hyperledger Kubernetes Replication ControllerWe will launch hyperledger on Kubernetes as a Replication Controller it will ensure us the high \u2014 availability of hyperledger pods.Create a file named membersrvc-rc.yml.apiVersion: v1 kind: ReplicationController metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: service: membersrvc name: membersrvc namespace: default spec: replicas: 1 selector: service: membersrvc template: metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: service: membersrvc spec: containers: -command: -membersrvc image: hyperledger / fabric - membersrvc imagePullPolicy: \"\" name: membersrvc ports: -containerPort: 7054 resources: {} restartPolicy: Always serviceAccountName: \"\" volumes: null status: replicas: 0In the same way, create another file vp0-rc.ymlapiVersion: v1 kind: ReplicationController metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: service: vp0 name: vp0 namespace: $ { NAMESPACE } spec: replicas: 1 selector: service: vp0 template: metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: service: vp0 spec: containers: -command: -sh - -c - sleep 5; peer node start--peer - chaincodedev env: -name: CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT value: \"true\" - name: CORE_VM_ENDPOINT value: unix: ///var/run/docker.sock -name: CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL value: DEBUG - name: CORE_PEER_ID value: vp0 - name: CORE_PEER_PKI_ECA_PADDR value: membersrvc: 7054 - name: CORE_PEER_PKI_TCA_PADDR value: membersrvc: 7054 - name: CORE_PEER_PKI_TLSCA_PADDR value: membersrvc: 7054 - name: CORE_SECURITY_ENABLED value: \"false\" - name: CORE_SECURITY_ENROLLID value: test_vp0 - name: CORE_SECURITY_ENROLLSECRET value: MwYpmSRjupbT image: hyperledger / fabric - peer imagePullPolicy: \"\" name: vp0 ports: -containerPort: 7050 - containerPort: 7051 - containerPort: 7053 resources: {} restartPolicy: Always serviceAccountName: \"\" volumes: null status: replicas: 0That\u2019s enough with the replication controller.

Now as you understand the basic fundamentals of BlockChain Technology, you need to decide whether BlockChain fits your needs or not. There will be a rush to develop new decentralized apps so as to enable the decentralized world that we are moving towards. Considering this fact, Business Leaders need to learn a new vocabulary around crypto-related frameworks.

Moreover, they have received favourable reviews from the VPN experts because they have some great features. For example, they have dual VPN service where your traffic is routed not via one but two VPN servers, each one adding its own encryption to the data, making it doubly difficult for anyone to eavesdrop. Secondly, they are registered in Panama where there is no data retention law so basically they are not entitled to capture user data at all.Coming to the pricing, they have a very competitive pricing model. You can connect up to 6 devices by paying for just one. They have three plans, simple, standard and best offer. Basically, they are 1 month, 6 month and 12 months subscription packages. Although it is not known well, you can actually subscribe to their services for 2 years as well and get 67% NordVPN discount. This is the most economical plan from NordVPN but it needs long time commitment indeed. On the other hand, if you want to commit for a month only, vyprvpn discount is not cheap. For better rates, you should try their annual or the bi-annual plans. Those are one of the lowest rates you will find in the market. Moreover, they always have some promotion or the other going on which means you can get even better rates.They also offer a 30 days moneyback trial period. You can try the service for 30 days. That will give you ample time to test all their features including the speed and ease of use.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["VPN", "Privacy", "Vyprvpn Discount", "Nordvpn Discount", "Nord Vpn Review"]}, {"title": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 2", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ekv%C3%A1dor-v%C3%BDprava-za-pivem/ned%C4%9Ble-20-ledna-guayaquil-fc6fb01feab6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zden\u00e1l F.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zdendaf", "publish_date": "2019-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-28", "readtime": "2.00", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 2Ned\u011ble 20. ledna\u200a\u2014\u200aGuayaquilZden\u00e1l F.FollowJan 27 \u00b7 3 min readJe ned\u011ble.

But lately, I started noticing this ever-growing \u201cwining\u201d trend grow even bigger. Namely that a glass of wine a day is incredibly beneficial for one\u2019s health. There are countless articles on the internet, we are constantly being reminded of this everywhere in the media, and if you go through the magazine aisle, almost every single issue of every single women\u2019s publication has at least one article that mentions the miraculous health benefits of wine. The widespread suggestion is that if you want to reap the benefits, you should drink a glass of wine every day.Once this started catching my attention, I just thought it was annoying and kind of corny. The articles usually revolve around a bunch of girlfriends drinking wine and destressing, followed by an absolute reassurance that what you are doing is amazing and that you shouldn\u2019t worry, what you\u2019re doing is actually healthy, followed by some clich\u00e9 funny comment along the lines of \u201cDon\u2019t save up all your 7 drinks for the weekend.\u201d So now that this wining religion has become ubiquitous, it is starting to get me worried. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the target market is women. I\u2019m still trying to figure out the reason for that, but in the meantime, what I want to talk about is the dubiousness and in some cases pure idiocy of the notion that daily alcohol consumption should even be considered a member of the healthy habits category.So the main argument is that wine helps protect against heart disease by preventing cholesterol buildup in your arteries. The list of cure-all benefits the media touts that I\u2019ve come across so far includes dementia, sunburn, life expectancy, anti-aging, diabetes, depression, risk of stroke, brain decline, cataracts, cancer, obesity, inflammation, the list goes on and on\u2026 You name it, the court of public opinion claims that wine can do it for you and then some. This story sounds great until you start thinking critically about the suggestion of these outlets.In reality, the ingredient you want to focus on when talking about wine consumption in a positive light is resveratrol. This is the \u201cmiraculous\u201d ingredient, which has been linked to beneficial results in life longevity and heart health. However, in our day and age, resveratrol is widely available as a supplement. On one hand, supplements are kind of a black hole. It is an unregulated industry, and while there are studies that suggest that supplements work, there\u2019s just as many others that suggest that supplements are useless. On the other hand, resveratrol is one of those supplements, which has gone through multiple studies that suggest considerable evidence of its effectiveness. So when we talk about the benefits of wine, we want to talk about the benefits of resveratrol, not the benefits of drinking the alcoholic beverage itself.Of course, every article on the subject stresses on moderation, but we are still talking about regular daily alcohol consumption. Would you think the same way if I told you that you should drink a shot of tequila (which, according to the CDC, also falls in the moderate drinking category) every day 365 days a year, or a shot of vodka every day 365 days a year and promote this as a healthy desirable lifestyle? Let\u2019s be clear. I have a problem with this trend specifically because the media outlets keep pushing this as healthy. And it kind of reminds me of the times when smoking was promoted through commercials, the media, and even doctors as healthy.While you may not be an alcoholic by definition, if you drink one glass of wine every day, you have definitely developed dependency, meaning this has become a habit. This habit is consistently damaging your health, particularly so if you are elderly, and in the meantime, you think you are reaping the benefits of resveratrol, and detoxing. Alcohol, any type of alcohol, is not, never was, and never will be a preventative beverage. Maybe it is true that back in the day, when water sanitation was virtually nonexistent, drinking beer and wine was much safer for one\u2019s health, but in a modern civilized society, that is not the case anymore. And when you read about the Egyptians, or the Greeks, and how they classified wine as medicine or some such nonsense, remember, we\u2019re talking about a time when life expectancy was about 30 years and the Earth was believed to be flat. Ancient Egyptians\u2019s understanding of medicine shouldn\u2019t be dictating your health habits. We live in 2019, we have a better (not perfect, but at least better) understanding of the science behind resveratrol and we know how to get the benefits of those ingredients without the harmful effects of alcohol.My verdict. If you want to drink wine every day because you enjoy it, it tastes good, or it\u2019s become part of your daily routine, by all means, go ahead. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s the gold standard when it comes to a healthy lifestyle, but assuming you\u2019re an adult, you have the freedom to do whatever you want with your health, no matter how stupid or detrimental it might be. But please, quit lying to yourself and spare me the nonsense about how you drink wine every day because of the health benefits. If you really just want to take advantage of said benefits, buy a bag of grapes, or if you\u2019re able to take supplements, go to your local vitamin store and get yourself some resveratrol. Enough with the argument about the supposed health benefits of drinking alcohol 365 days a year.Cheers to that.Read the whole article on my website here or go straight to www.dailyviper.com for more glorious content.

I\u2019m a regular vaper, by which I mean that I use a vaping device on a daily basis, typically multiple times a day. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. For more than a decade, I was a smoker. And for the latter part of that period, I was a heavy smoker or what is known as a \u201cchain smoker.\u201dGoodbye smoke, hello vapor.Some friends called me a chimney. While obviously not polite, it was a fairly accurate portrayal of my cigarette intake as I could often be found puffing out a cloud of smoke.The Reason I Quit Smoking And Started Vaping InsteadThen things changed. Here\u2019s what changed: I got sick.It all started what is now years ago when my health went on the decline. It wasn\u2019t just smoking, but rather a perfect storm of ailments that ultimately left me with a difficult choice to make: quit smoking or remain ill. Choosing to quit smoking, I gave it an honest shot. I\u2019d tried before and it had never worked out, not for more than a matter of weeks anyhow. But this time was a bit different, as I actually felt the absolute need to quit. I was desperate and ready to try anything that might work.Before this, I had tried vaping before but I wasn\u2019t entirely impressed. In the early stages of vaping, the products weren\u2019t nearly as impressive as they are today. They were rather cheaply made, depleted their batteries quickly, and often leaked e-juice directly in my mouth. Fortunately, the technology has seen some advances since vaping first became popular and so I figured I\u2019d give it another try.The First Vape That Worked For MeAt first, I picked up a Blu brand e-cigarette and some cartomizers, which are also known as vape cartridges. The cartomizers are the part that contain the e-liquid. They attach directly to the vape battery and with that, you have an e-cig. I\u2019d seen the Blu brand floating around at local retailers, such as gas stations, and I figured it would be convenient to switch to a readily available brand so I gave it a shot. It worked just well enough to help me begin to make the switch.In the beginning, the Blu e-cigs did the trick- they allowed me to dramatically reduce the amount I smoked as I gradually became more and more comfortable with the vapor. But I wasn\u2019t thoroughly impressed. I figured there had to be something better on the market and I was right, there are.The E-Cig I Use TodayAfter vaping my cheap e-cigs for a while, I eventually started to branch out and explore the other options. I was well aware of the Juul brand, as they\u2019re also carried at local retailers around where I live and so I figured I\u2019d give them a shot because I\u2019d heard good things from friends. Without putting too much thought into it, I snagged one. It worked. Not only did it work, it worked a lot better than what I had been using up until then. As you can imagine, it wasn\u2019t long before I hopped brands, switching from Blu to Juul.These days, now being a daily vaper, I\u2019ve grown quite fond of my Juul. Sure, there is nicotine in there, which is what helped me quit smoking in the first place, but it feels a lot less damaging than smoking. In fact, my health has improved quite dramatically since I gave up the cigarettes and started vaping. Of course, scientists continue to research, weigh, and debate their findings, but for me, it\u2019s as obvious as the difference between a salad and cheeseburger- one clearly being healthier than the other. So while scientists continue to explore the potential health risks of vaping, I\u2019m comfortable in my belief that vaping is truly the less harmful option. And I\u2019m definitely not the only one who thinks this, as just take Public Health England\u2019s findings from their latest e-cigarette review, which found vaping to be somewhere around 95% less harmful than smoking. That is a huge difference and for me, it\u2019s a world of difference. It\u2019s the difference between feeling like I have COPD and breathing fine while I rest my little head at night. A world of difference.The Benefits, From My PerspectiveFor me, it\u2019s been a long time since I was huffing down a pack of cigarettes each day and at this point, I feel pretty healthy. I wouldn\u2019t say I feel great, but I do feel good. When I go for a run, I find myself breathing hard, but I don\u2019t find myself gasping for air and coughing my brains out. So as far as activities go, everything\u2019s just that much easier now that I\u2019ve made the switch.I used to stink. If you\u2019re a smoker, you might not notice it, but you smell. The more you smoke, the worse you smell. It really is that simple. Having switched to vaping, I don\u2019t smell anymore. Who wants to be stinky? Not me. Imagine hopping out of the shower, smelling fresh and clean, only to step out and have a smoke and find yourself stinking again. Not ideal. But with vaping, there\u2019s none of that. In fact, quite a few people in my life who would prefer I not smoke around them don\u2019t mind one bit if I vape inside of their homes or cars. It really is that big of a difference.Breathing better is great and so is being less stinky, but there\u2019s another big kicker here and it\u2019s the ability to smell and taste better. After a while, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that my sense of smell and my ability to taste had improved. This isn\u2019t as important to me as breathing better, but it\u2019s definitely good for something. It also made me that much more aware of how bad smokers smell.No more stains on my fingertips and disgusting smelling fingers and hands is another benefit. While the staining wouldn\u2019t always be apparent, the smell of my hands was just atrocious. I became quite used to it over time but now that I\u2019ve stopped smoking, I can\u2019t believe I ever smelled like that. Mind you, I\u2019m a relatively well kept chap and walking around smelling like an ashtray is certainly far from appealing to me.My Future With Vaping, The Way I See ItWhile I\u2019ve come a long way since my days of smoking and have even managed to recruit some friends over from the dark side (smoking), there is still much I\u2019d like to accomplish. So while I have kicked the smoking habit, I would like to dial back my intake with vaping. While it does clearly seem to be the better option and not by some small margin, I would like to decrease my dependency on the nicotine contained within the e-juice that I vape. To do this though, I\u2019m likely best served by a different device.The problem with the Juul vapes is that they, up until recently, have only been available in one nicotine strength. For some of the people like me, former smokers using vaping to quit smoking, there is appeal in the different nicotine strengths that some e-juice manufacturers offer. With Juul, there are some blatant limitations. At the moment, that I\u2019m aware of, they offer only two nicotine strengths. To top this off, Juul\u2019s refills are pretty expensive. This is why I\u2019m looking at a number of alternatives, like the Vaper Empire brand of vaping supplies, which include refillable vapes, e-cigs, and e-juice that can be purchased separately. With Juul, just for reference, you\u2019re buying these packs of pods that are filled with e-juice. You don\u2019t fill them yourself and there\u2019s no refilling. You use them and then you toss them. It\u2019s not cost effective and it\u2019s not preferable. But with brands like Vaper Empire, you not only have the ability to refill your cartomizers and tanks, you also have the ability to purchase e-juice at a reasonable price and in a variety of nicotine strengths that go all the way down to no nicotine or \u201c0 nic\u201d as some refer to it. And with the different nicotine strengths that they offer their vape juice in, vapers like myself can gradually reduce their nicotine intake while maintaining the same level of use (actual puffs).My Next VapeThe next e-liquid vape that I\u2019d like to pickup is Vaper Empire\u2019s Vibe Series Deluxe, which has a large 4.5 milliliter tank that\u2019s designed to be refilled and a powerful 2000mAh battery that I\u2019m guessing lasts a lot longer between charges than what I\u2019m using now. And the best part: I can use any e-juice I want. Not being limited to just one brand of e-juice has its appeal to me, especially after using only Juul brand e-juice, which only comes in so many flavors, for so long. I\u2019ve read some really positive reviews from other vapers that have tried it and at this point- I\u2019m pretty enticed. It looks and sounds like an excellent fit for me given that it\u2019s powerful, refillable, and still fits in my pocket. While not as small as what I\u2019m using currently, I\u2019ll trade the small size of my current vape for the ability to vaporize other e-liquids in a heartbeat.The End Game For MeWhile my initial goal with vaping, which has proven successful, was simply to quit smoking, my end goal is to eventually vape very little or not at all. The way I believe I\u2019ll get there is via slowly reducing the amount of nicotine that I\u2019m getting by gradually moving to lower and lower nicotine strength juices. Will I get there eventually? I think so but only time will tell.Day To Day LifeFor the most part, my day to day existence is similar to it once was, only I breathe better, feel better, cough less, stink less, and find myself forced outdoors less. That last part due to the fact that while I used to smoke strictly outdoors, I now vape indoors a considerable portion of the time. The reality, as far as I\u2019m aware, is that the scientific research into vaping\u2019s impact on an indoor air quality is limited, but there is evidence to suggest that it\u2019s nowhere near as harmful as smoking indoors \u2014 at least as far as secondhand vapor and secondhand smoke are concerned.Vaping, from what I\u2019ve personally found, seems to be much less offensive to those around me. For the most part, those who would otherwise take great offense to the lighting of a cigarette indoors simply do not seem to care if I vape indoors, at least that\u2019s what they tell me. The end result is that I spend a lot less time outside in the proverbial smoker\u2019s corner and a lot more time indoors, enjoying the things that I like to do.On top of all this, I also spend less money on vaping supplies than I did on cigarettes and lighters.So as you can see, switching from smoking to vaping has had a significant impact on my life and as far as I\u2019m concerned- it\u2019s all been positive. I\u2019m glad I made the switch. It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever set out to do and actually accomplished, but it appears to have been well worth the effort.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vaping", "Quitting Smoking", "Vape", "Experience", "Life"]}, {"title": "Vaper Empire Now Ships All Orders With DHL Express For Lightning Fast Delivery", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vaperempire/vaper-empire-now-ships-all-orders-with-dhl-express-for-lightning-fast-delivery-6f572e1a61fd?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vaper Empire", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vaperempire", "publish_date": "2019-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-14", "readtime": "1.45", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vaper Empire Now Ships All Orders With DHL Express For Lightning Fast DeliveryVaper EmpireFollowJan 13 \u00b7 2 min readGet fast, low-cost shipping on vape supplies from Vaper Empire with DHL Express shipping.Vaper Empire, one of Australia\u2019s leading premium vape brands, now ships all customer orders with DHL Express.

Is a large portion of your daily expense going into smoking? Do you enjoy the experience or has it just become a habit? Most people smoke cigarettes because it becomes a habit of sorts. Whenever they are with friends or take some time out from work, they usually enjoy a smoke. Smoking tobacco cigarettes doesn\u2019t really accompany a good experience with it. But, if you will say the same in front of a regular smoker, he would quite confidently disagree. If you have developed a habit of smoking regularly and like that feeling of holding a cigarette and inhaling/exhaling the smoke, you can turn to a less harmful way of keeping that habit close to you. Electronic cigarettes and different types of other such devices are gaining huge popularity around the world. It is mainly the tobacco cigarette smokers who are switching their smoking habits for the better. And many people who haven\u2019t smoked a cigarette in their lives due to its harmful effects are also taking on this new way, knowing that they won\u2019t have to suffer the same consequences as many traditional smokers do.The most important part of an electronic cigarette or other such devices is its atomizer, which could have a different name depending on the type of electronic vaping device you are using. This part contains the all important e-juice or e-liquid that is responsible for producing vapor. So, without e-juice, e-cigs are nothing. While you may safely say that traditional cigarettes don\u2019t come with a flavor to talk about, e-cigs are mostly known for the variety of favors it allows you to enjoy. In addition, the nicotine content in e-juices is very limited as compared to that present in traditional tobacco cigarettes.So, an e-cig fueled with an e-juice provides you a similar experience without the harmful effects. When you begin the switch, you should go for an e-juice with a moderate nicotine content, and as you get used to the whole concept, you can get the nicotine content down each time. This will help you get over smoking, without you even knowing about it or feeling any withdrawal symptoms. There are many brands and types of e-juices available in the market today. If you want to experience high-end vaping, you can turn to Pound Cake e-liquid by Glas Vapor. On the other hand, if you want to experience a fizzy berry flavor, you should buy Pop Berry e-juice by Ramune Pop. There are a plenty of options, choose ones that you find interesting.Author\u2019s Bio: The author is a blogger. This article is about e-cigs and e-juices.

The study that they are citing, though factually true, isn\u2019t true for real world vaping. The scientists tested their ecigarette at a very high voltage of 5.0, which no vaper would actually use with a coil temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature, which you can imagine, would cause the eliquid to burn and would lead to an undesirable burnt taste that all vapers try to avoid. Ecig users vape at the normal coil temperature between 392\u2013500 degrees Fahrenheit. As you can see, the coil the researchers tested was over double the real world coil temperature that vapers use.\u201cAren\u2019t vaping and smoking the same thing?\u201dActually, vaping is NOT smoking. Smoking involves combustion or the burning of tobacco leaves. Whereas vaping involves heating up (vaporizing) a liquid to create vapor. There is absolutely no combustion involved. Cigarettes also contain over 4,000 chemicals and 43 of those chemicals are known carcinogens and 400 other known toxins. Eliquid in quality ecigarettes only have four ingredients and these four ingredients have all been FDA approved.\u201cDo you even know what\u2019s in that juice?\u201dBut we do, unlike with tobacco cigarettes. Eliquids are composed of up to four main ingredients, a main base of propylene glycol, which has been on the FDA\u2019s generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list and has been used in many products that consumers use daily, like albuterol or in asthma inhalers. PG is a perfect carrier of flavorings and offers the throat hit that smokers enjoy. The second ingredient is vegetable glycerin which is also on the FDA\u2019s GRAS list and like PG is also used in many products that people use / consume daily. VG, unlike PG does not hold flavor very well and is much thicker in consistency, but it does produce thick clouds when vaporized. This is why most manufacturers of eliquids use a combination of both PG and VG as their base as it affords both characteristics needed for a perfect vape. The third ingredient in eliquid are flavorings, these are always food-grade and can be natural or artificial, they are the same type of flavorings that are use in the food and beverages people consume everyday. The final ingredient is liquid nicotine. The liquid nicotine used is pharmaceutical grade and affords eliquid makers to create bottles that range in nicotine content depending on the user\u2019s preference.\u201cHave you heard the latest ecigarette news story?\u201dDon\u2019t believe everything you hear on the news or read on the Internet, those scaremongering articles and stories aren\u2019t always true. But the fact is most people do not have time or the attention span to go digging for the truth regarding articles they read or news they hear on the TV or radio and they simply accept them as reliable and true.\u201cDon\u2019t those blow up in your face?\u201dMost of the ecigarette malfunctions that you hear about are due to misuse where the user failed to follow the instructions of the manufacturer. The very few reports of ecigarettes that have failed during use or charging was because the user tried to charge their ecigarette with a charger that did not come with their kit. For mechanical mods, that is a little different. When a new user first asks about a mechanical mod, the first thing a more experienced user will tell them is to make sure that they do their research first and very thoroughly. Mechanical mods do not come with electrical protections; they are called unregulated because of this. Mods are really only suitable for those who have done their research and know what they are doing.Ready to try the finest quality ecigarettes and eliquids?

Obviously I\u2019ve been reading a lot and watching a ton of pro and con YouTube videos since then, and I really think these things are a good solution for people who want to quit smoking.What was I doing smoking???I smoked for 15 years and quit for 10, and then I had a bad day. A bad day after a bad week. My coworkers smoke. I bummed one cigarette, and in 2 days, I was right back where I had been 10 years ago, smoking a pack a day. Addiction is addiction. Smoking is filthy and bad for you, but I\u2019ve always loved to smoke. I suppose I have an addictive personality, whatever that means: I\u2019m a creature of habit and get hooked on habits very easily.I really think these things are a good solution for people who want to quit smokingI loved the ritual, the \u201chit,\u201d the socialization\u2026but I didn\u2019t like knowing I was destroying my health, smelling like an ashtray, and spending a fortune.Why vaping?I knew next to nothing about e-cigarettes until I ran in to someone who had one in a situation where we had to make small talk. I asked her about it, and she was super knowledgeable about it and enthusiastic. She\u2019d quit smoking years before by using vaping.Any thinking person can find enough information, easily, to make a choice. My choice is \u201cit is better than smoking cigarettes.\u201dSo I did some research, and that\u2019s easy to do with vaping. Apparently I\u2019ve been living under a rock, because there is a HUGE vaping community, and it\u2019s kind of a hot topic. Any thinking person can find enough information, easily, to make a choice. My choice is \u201cit is better than smoking cigarettes.\u201dFirst impressionsI was inexplicably intimidated by the process of actually setting myself up to vape. Normally I love gadgets and widgets and shopping for same, but in this case I didn\u2019t care for the deviation in my routine of buying the same cigarettes as usual and carrying on. Habit, you see. I persevered and went to an actual vape shop, because I\u2019m lucky enough to live in a hipster college town where we have those. It was fairly painless. The nice man at the store helped me pick a flavor (I\u2019m basically a big kid, so yes, my e-cigarette tastes like Skittles) and showed me how to assemble the widget and get started. He did recommend I start with a too-low dose of nicotine; you can pick how strong you want them to be, and he gave me the lowest dose up from nothing. Not helpful in killing cravings. So I went back the next day and got another bottle that was stronger. That\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ll be stepping down and I\u2019ll be prepared, is all.I decided when I got up the next day that I\u2019d just see how it went going an entire day without a cigarette, and I did itThat first night I did have a couple of cigarettes. I don\u2019t know whether it was the comfort of familiarity or the issue of having hardly any nicotine in the vape-er, or both. But I decided when I got up the next day that I\u2019d just see how it went going an entire day without a cigarette, and I did it! This is day 2 for me, and I\u2019m feeling fine. I have no desire, actually, to inhale more nasty-tasting smoke.I\u2019m filled with the zeal of the newly converted.ConsNothing is perfect.Hipster cachet. Vaping is super trendy, apparently, and the hype is wearing. I like the down-and-dirty process of buying my same cigarettes all the time.Complicated gadgets. Cigarettes are pretty simple. You buy them. You light them. You smoke them. E-cigarettes, not so much. There is a confusing variety of \u201csetups,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t take long to start drowning in a sea of \u201cmods,\u201d volts, watts, drippers, and milligrams.Weird reactions. People judge me for smoking, and rightly so, but they also judge me for vaping. \u201cSmoking perfume is bad for you,\u201d said a close friend (who smokes like a chimney). (I\u2019m willing to believe that it is; however, I think it\u2019s plain as day that e-cigarettes are MUCH LESS HARMFUL than cigarettes).Another thing to charge and maintain. The e-cigarette is a gadget, and as such it has to be charged regularly and messed with. You have to change the coils and, of course, add your e-liquids. I do feel a twinge of irritation at night when I go around putting all my Things on their chargers and have one more Thing to deal with.Cough. The first few times I vaped, I coughed like a tuberculous sailor. It doesn\u2019t work to vape like you smoke, and the experience was unpleasant. But I figured it out.ProsThere is a lot of \u201cstinky\u201d reduction, here.You smell better. After being smoke free for 10 years, I did not like going back to stinking. I managed to deal with it and press on, but smelling like an ashtray is no bueno. Vapor smells fruity (at least mine does) and doesn\u2019t stick to your clothes and car and house.Neat and tidy. Now I just have one thing to carry around with me, versus a pack of cigarettes, a lighter, and an ashtray. There is no pile of stinky butts to throw away. There is a lot of \u201cstinky\u201d reduction, here.Efficiency. I think with cigarettes I\u2019d light one and be done with it after a few puffs, but I didn\u2019t want to screw with stubbing it out and saving it and also didn\u2019t want to waste half of it, so I\u2019d smoke the whole thing anyway. With the e-cigarette, I take a vape or two and then I\u2019m done (or not). No muss, no fuss. No more having cigarettes just burning in an ashtray next to me.\u2026if it\u2019s a toss-up between inhaling thousands of chemicals that are known to be really bad for and inhaling 4 substances that are relatively innocuous, I\u2019ll go for the latter.It feels cleaner. I\u2019m still inhaling things into my lungs, but a lot FEWER things. I feel like inhaling burning anything is probably pretty bad for you, but I also feel like if it\u2019s a toss-up between inhaling thousands of chemicals that are known to be really bad for and inhaling 4 substances that are relatively innocuous, I\u2019ll go for the latter.Fun. I like any opportunity to modify and customize my Things. You can\u2019t really dress up a cigarette, but you can totally dress up an e-cigarette. Some e-cigarettes are cool rainbow-looking things. Mine isn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll really get in to any of that, but I like that it\u2019s an option. If anyone would ever have a pink and lime green e-cigarette with green apple e-liquid in it, it would be me. As it is I have skull-and-heart washi tape wrapped around mine. (See \u201cbig kid,\u201d above.)My misconceptions, debunkedI\u2019m really glad I just happened in to that conversation with a knowledgeable person about e-cigarettes, because I had almost no real information and a lot of prejudices and misconceptions.You might as well just smoke. This is a great rationalization if you\u2019re wedded to your weeds, but, just, no. Cigarettes have literally thousands of awful chemicals in them that are known to cause cancer and jack up your lungs. E-cigarette liquid has, typically, four, and none of them is known to do much of anything.Nicotine is dangerous. It has surprised me to learn that nicotine is not all that bad. In my brain, \u201cnicotine\u201d and \u201ccigarettes\u201d have been synonymous, but nicotine is just one thing. It does have health risks, true, but they\u2019re actually fairly minor. I don\u2019t see that it\u2019s any worse than drinking coffee or eating fast food. It\u2019s certainly safer than driving a car.Vaping is a gateway to big tobacco. When I examine this logically, I don\u2019t know why I believed it, because the opposite is assuredly true. Big tobacco must be heavily invested in putting a stop to vaping because they have good reason to be afraid; my own experience so far verifies that a person really can just stop smoking cigarettes painlessly by vaping.Vaping is bad because it\u2019s marketed to minors. Again, actual thought debunks this easily enough. You can\u2019t buy vaping supplies if you\u2019re under 18, just the same as cigarettes or other tobacco products. \u201cCandy-flavored e-liquids suck kids in.\u201d I don\u2019t buy it; maybe actual CANDY would. Some kids are going to find a way to vape, same as they find ways to smoke and chew and drink alcohol, but I don\u2019t think your average kid would want to monkey with the up-front expense and upkeep involved with vaping. Also, I notice that actual cigarettes and chewing tobacco come in plenty of flavors as well (my boyfriend assures me that peach chaw is a Thing), so I really see zero merit to this claim.Vaping is just a hipster craze. This one might be kind of true, but vaping is catching on to a wider crowd. When I went to the vape shop to buy stuff, twice, the first time the other customer was an older man, not at all hip, and the second time the place was filled with the same cross-section of society you\u2019d see at McDonald\u2019s (minus the kids and plus a pretty pit bull watching TV behind the counter). I guess I\u2019m not really all that put off by hipsters anyway. I wear Chuck Taylors and have piercings and tattoos, so I can\u2019t really judge, can I?I\u2019m coming up on 48 hours without a cigarette, despite its being a long weekend filled with situations like coffee. So that could speak for itself. If you\u2019re a smoker or a healthcare professional or someone who loves a smoker, do your research and consider e-cigarettes.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Vaping", "Smoking", "Health"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@colinclarkson/the-tpd-is-here-what-do-u-k-vapers-need-to-know-b6089fde551f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Colin Clarkson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@colinclarkson", "publish_date": "2017-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-16", "readtime": "0.38", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Colin ClarksonFollowMay 16, 2017 \u00b7 1 min read", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Perfect Clarity at an Incredible Speed", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@viperprotection/perfect-clarity-at-an-incredible-speed-b558d6db6a5e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Viper Protection Blog!", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@viperprotection", "publish_date": "2018-12-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-31", "readtime": "1.78", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Perfect Clarity at an Incredible SpeedViper Protection Blog!FollowDec 31, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readCriminal activity flourishes in certain places more than others. Typically, parking garages/lots can be ideal locations for crime. Dark corners, tight spaces, and multiple levels and/or rows of cars are prime spots for criminals to lurk and attack unsuspecting victims, especially women. It is vital that monitoring and surveillance is conducted in such places. Other places which are equally sensitive include train stations, airports, factories, offices, casinos, banks, museums, military areas, housing estates, major highways and traffic intersections, public squares, city centers, car parking lots, sports events, subway trains, amusement park rides etc.Keeping an Eye Has Never Been EasierSurveillance is much easier these days and not as expensive as it used to be. Look for the kind of camera which has the resolution that you prefer. Such a camera is even available in multi camera systems which carry out surveillance from different angles. The price is basically dependent on the features and image resolution. A solar powered security camera can be used indoors or outdoors. It works in any weather conditions and even has a built-in heater. It uses cutting-edge technology including a high performance camera with a PTZ lens, rapid positioning, and the ability to automatically adjust to changes in light and object distances.The H.264 outdoor wireless solar power security IP camera boasts nine preset positions monitoring. Its motion detection alert with snapshots via email allowing remote view and recording from anywhere anytime makes it particularly desirable. It offers the option of multi-level user management with password protection. Solar powered CCTV cameras are used to avoid crime and identify any suspicious activity in the public places. The recorded images are saved on either tapes or digital devices to maintain the database.Capture Evidence and Deter Criminal ActivityAdd to that the deterrent aspect which means a break-in is less likely to occur, and secondly if an intruder does enter then the chances of capturing them are increased because you have video evidence available. There is a professional image sensor inside the outdoor wireless solar power IP security camera which has 1.3 megapixel HD capabilities. There is also a new window solar powered outdoor security camera with 3000mah. Its solar panel\u2019s power capability is 5w, while the battery display has 4 blue LEDs. It has an ultra-thin modeling design, fashionable appearance, which is both beautiful and easy.

It is a\u201cplatform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.\u201dHyperledger Fabric is well documented and has detailed tutorials on getting started. There are many queries in Hyperledger Fabric that revolves around extending the existing network i.e adding a new organization, adding a new peer, changing consortium policy and etc. Adding a new Org has already been explained here. It is a bit lengthy but explains a lot of the process of how it all fit together.Today we will extend an existing Fabric network by adding a new peer to it.PrerequisitesThis guide requires you to first follow Build You First Network from the Hyperledger tutorials. Also, it installs all the necessary prerequisites and dependencies that are important for this tutorial as well.To learn how to deploy your fabric network on multiple host, read my article hereIf you want to skip the above tutorial and want to try this regardless, you must install all the prerequisite as stated below:Before we begin, if you haven\u2019t already done so, you may wish to check that you have all the Prerequisites installed on the platform(s) on which you\u2019ll be developing blockchain applications and/or operating Hyperledger Fabric.You will also need to download and install the Hyperledger Fabric Samples. You will notice that there are a number of samples included in the fabric-samplesrepository. We will be using the first-network sample. Let\u2019s open that sub-directory now.Make sure that you checkout the repo at:git checkout 1.1.0-alphaAnd install the tools by executing:curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | bash -s 1.1.0-alphaThis is essential for this tutorial. To generate new crypto-material for new peer, we need to use the extend command of the cryptogen tool, which is only available in 1.1.0-alpha version.Bootstrap the NetworkThe first step is to follow the guide to Build Your First Network but you need to start the network with CouchDB (you can read more about it here). You can do this by executing:$ ./byfn.sh -m up -s couchdb -t 10000000At the end of this tutorial, you must have a running network with the below topology:--Orderer--Org1----Peer0----couchdb0----Peer1----couchdb1Org2----Peer0----couchdb2----Peer1----couchdb3So we have an Orderer, 2 Org and two peers one each Org. Each Peer is also connected with an instance of Couchdb to store peer ledger. you can verify the network components by executing:$ docker psYou can see that all the containers are up and running as shown in the diagram below:The script, which is part of this tutorial and executed by cli, installs, instantiates and invokes chain code. We can verify this for peer0 \u2014 Org1 at :http://localhost:5984/_utils/#database/mychannel_mycc/_all_docsIt will show two records a and b. You can verify for other peers as well and they all will have the same ledger since they are part of a distributed network and have joined same channel \u201cmychannel\u201d. You can find the ports for different Couchdb instances in docker-compose-couch.yaml and read more about it here.Generating Crypto Material for New PeerWe will use cryptogen tool which is installed in the bin folder for generating crypto material for our new peer. The key command is extend which is only available in 1.1.0-alpha.The cryptogen extend command allows to extend an existing network, meaning generating all the additional key material needed by the newly added entities.The commands need a config file to generate new crypto material. The config file in our case is crypto-config.yaml. We will open that file in the editor and change the template count from 2 to 3 for Org2.Save the file and open a new terminal. CD into first-network folder and execute (make sure you are in first-network folder):../bin/cryptogen extend --config=./crypto-config.yamlThe command will create crypto-material for the new peer. You can find the new peer (peer2 folder) and all the required crypto material atcd crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/If you face any permission error during the execution, you can use chmod command to give necessary permissions, i.esudo chmod 755 -R ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/If everything went smoothly, we will now spawn a new peer and its Couchdb container.Spawning new Peer & Couchdb ContainerTo spawn a new peer and a Couchdb instance for it, you will need the docker compose definitions for it. You can download the per-developed compose file at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5rfilwsF4HQbFJiSXhpYW5UVU9DckpRc2xfZEVrMTY2bmk0/view?usp=sharingDownload and save the file in the first-network folder.It has docker scripts for peer2 and Couchdb. Now, open a new terminal and from first-network kick off the new docker compose:$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-new-peer.yaml up -dThis new compose file has been configured to bridge across our initial network, so the new peer and the couchdb container will be able to resolve with the existing peers and ordering node.you can verify by$ docker psthat it has successfully spawned a new peer and its Couchdb. Now if you go tohttp://localhost:9984/_utils/#database/mychannel_mycc/_all_docsYou will not find any data contrary to the dashboard of existing peers\u2019 couchdb. It is because the peer has been successfully spawned and accepted by the network but it has not joined the channel to which the whole network is connected so it doesn\u2019t have the ledger data. A channel is :A Hyperledger Fabric channel is a private \u201csubnet\u201d of communication between two or more specific network members, for the purpose of conducting private and confidential transactions. A channel is defined by members (organizations), anchor peers per member, the shared ledger, chaincode application(s) and the ordering service node(s). Each transaction on the network is executed on a channel, where each party must be authenticated and authorized to transact on that channel.Next we need our newly created peer to join the channel \u201cmychannel\u201d. Lets move forward and do it.Join the ChannelWe will enter the CLI container using the docker exec command, Execute it in another terminal:$ docker exec -it cli bashIf successful you should see the following:root@0d78bb69300d:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#from here onwards, we will execute all the commands in this terminalTime to setup some environment variables, execute them on cli terminal:export CHANNEL_NAME=mychannelCORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=\"Org2MSP\"CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crtCORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/mspCORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer2.org2.example.com:7051Now it's time to for the newly spawned peer to join the channel, execute:$ peer channel join -b mychannel.blockSuccessfully joined the channelAfter the peer has joined the channel, browse back to:http://localhost:9984/_utils/#database/mychannel_mycc/_all_docsYou will know that the peer has synced the peer ledger successfully. Go ahead and install, invoke and query chain-code on the new peer. By using cryptogen extend, you can extend your network and add more participants.Whats Next\u2026.The implementation of chaincode execution on hyperledger fabric tutorials are still in development mode, that is why I have been playing around with load balancing chaincode execution using HProxy to make it production ready.Also, I have been working around with blockchain explorer to monitor the different matrices of the network in action i.e. blocks, transaction, throughput, active nodes and etc.I will post them soon.Kindly try this tutorial and feel free to feedback if you face any issue in the implementation. I will be more than happy to assist you.Happy Blockchaining :)", "responses": 24, "tags": ["Hyperledger", "Hyperledger Fabric", "Add A New Peer", "Blockchain Development", "Reconfigure The Network"]}, {"title": "ERC20 Tokens on HyperLedger Fabric", "post_link": "https://medium.com/deqode/erc20-tokens-on-hyperledger-b82399b4b969?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ayush Tiwari", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ayushtiwari_87831", "publish_date": "2018-09-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-03", "readtime": "9.55", "claps": 561, "voters": 84, "content": "ERC20 Tokens on HyperLedger FabricAyush TiwariFollowSep 24, 2018 \u00b7 10 min readHyperledger is being chosen by many new innovators to handle their blockchain end of things, due to its high TPS and behaviour as a blockchain as a service platform.

So, in this blog we\u2019ll discuss the methodology to create an ERC20 based token Chaincode in HyperLedger, using Node.js.Why ERC20?ERC20 is a widely tested and accepted standard in Ethereum and incorporating it in Hyperledger can make the task of writing a secure and scalable chaincode for any token based on Hyperledger easy.We will refer to the following open source repository during our tutorial.You can also directly go through README of the repository if you\u2019re a developer.NOTE: We assume that you\u2019re already familiar with HyperLedger Fabric, and your system is equipped with the prerequisites to kick-start development on HyperLedger. If not, refer to prerequisites, key concepts, and tutorials in HyperLedger documentation.Getting StartedThe code in this repository has been tested in the following environment:Node: v8.9.3 and v8.11.4Hyperledger fabric: v1.2Docker: 18.06.1-cePython: 2.7.12Go: go1.9.3 linux/amd64Curl: 7.47.0We would recommend using the same version while adapting to our code.After making sure the prerequisites are installed properly, follow the following steps:cd path/to/repository/foldercd networkOnce you are in the network folder, you can create our hyperledger network environment. It will create 2 organizations for you (Org1 and Org2) respectively, with an Orderer having 2 peers each.HousekeepingIf it\u2019s your second time running this tutorial, or you have successfully run any other HyperLedger Fabric based code then we suggest you to first run the following commands:./buildERC20TokenNetwork.sh downIt will ask for a confirmation:Stopping for channel 'mychannel' with CLI timeout of '10' seconds and CLI delay of '3' secondsContinue? [Y/n]Press Y and continue.Note: You can always check how many containers or volumes of docker are up and running by using the following commands:docker psdocker volume lsIf you struggle to shut down containers and volumes using the script, try running the following commands:docker network prunedocker volume prunedocker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)Token Network SetupOnce you\u2019re done with the Housekeeping, you are ready to start your network by making use of the following commands:./buildERC20TokenNetwork.sh upStarting for channel 'mychannel' with CLI timeout of '10' seconds and CLI delay of '3' secondsContinue? [Y/n] Y...It may take some time to execute (usually between 90- 120 seconds to execute). However, if you see the following log in your terminal, that means it executed successfully and your network is ready to use.========= All GOOD, execution completed =========== _____   _   _   ____| ____| | \\ | | |  _ \\|  _|   |  \\| | | | | || |___  | |\\  | | |_| ||_____| |_| \\_| |____/It created the required certificates for each entity of HyperLedger using the crypto-config.yaml file, in a folder named crypto-config within your networks directory. Check it out!It also created channel.tx, genesis.block, Org1MSPanchors.tx and Org1MSPanchors.tx.Note: We cannot cover everything in this README, to understand the intricacies behind the process in detail go through this tutorial.It also created docker containers and volumes for:peer0 and peer1 or Org1peer0 and peer1 of Org2ordererCLIchaincodeCheck them using docker ps and docker volume ls. We also created a channel name mychannel between Org1 and Org2, both the peers of each org are a part of this channel. Then installed our chaincode on peer0 of each org and instantiated our chaincode, naming it mycc. You can see the logs of respective peer/chaincode using:docker logs <peer identity> // type peer and then tab to see your optionsdocker logs <chaincode identity> // type dev and then tab to see your optionsNote: For debugging you can access your chaincode and peers logs docker logs <press TAB to see options>; and If you don\u2019t see a container for chaincode (dev-peer0.org1.techracers.com-mycc-1.0) then there was a problem instantiating our token chaincode.Let\u2019s play with our tokenNow that our chaincode is up and running, let\u2019s try some getter and setter functions to understand it better. For that, we need to enter the CLI container which we have created.docker exec -it cli bashNow, you\u2019ll see something like this:root@0e2b84a5cedc:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#Getter functionsOnce you\u2019re in the CLI, you can call the getter functions provided in our SimpleToken. We\u2019ll discuss each one of them accessible to you one by one:getOwnerThis function will return the owner of the token contract. Now it is the MSPID which instantiated the contract, you can see it here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getOwner\"]}'Org1MSPHere mychannel is our channel name and mycc is the name of our chaincode, and as you can see Org1MSP is the current owner of our chaincode.getNameThis function will return the name of our token contract. It was set to Simple Token while instantiating the contract, you can see it here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getName\"]}'Simple TokenAs you can see, Simple Token is our current token name.getSymbolThis function will return the symbol for our token contract. It was set to SMT while instantiating the contract, you can see it here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getSymbol\"]}'SMTAs you can see SMT is our current token symbol.getTotalSupplyThis function will return the total supply for our token contract. It defaults to 0 until it is set. You can find the required logic here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getTotalSupply\"]}'0As you can see 0 is our current total supply.isMintingAllowedThis getter returns the value of isMintingAllowed boolean stored on HyperLedger. It defaults to undefined until it is set once. You can find the required logic here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"isMintingAllowed\"]}'undefinedAs you can see isMintingAllowed is now, undefined. It will return true or false once set later.getAllowanceThis getter returns the value of allowance set by a token owner for a spender MSPID. It takes as \u2018Input the MSPID token\u2019 owner as the first argument and \u2018MSPID of spender\u2019 as the second argument. It defaults to 0 until it is set. You can find the required logic here.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getAllowance\", \"Org1MSP\", \"Org2MSP\"]}'0As you can see, getAllowance is now 0. It will return float once set later. Let\u2019s also check for the other combination we have and see if it returns 0.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getAllowance\", \"Org2MSP\", \"Org1MSP\"]}'0getBalanceOfOur last getter is getBalanceOf function, it returns the token balance of every MSPID we enter. It also defaults to 0 if the MSPID don\u2019t have any token balance.peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getBalanceOf\", \"Org1MSP\"]}'0peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"getBalanceOf\", \"Org2MSP\"]}'0You can check out the required code here.Setter functionsOnce you\u2019re done with the getter calls, let\u2019s explore the setter functions provided in our SimpleToken. Remember you will need to satisfy the endorsement policy before you can make these transactions happen, on that account you will see some extra fields here. It will also take some time when a setter is called for the first time to a specific peer, later it returns results almost instantaneously. Also right now the CLI\u2019s configuration is set to Org1 peer0, which you can check using:echo $CORE_PEER_ADDRESSpeer0.org1.techracers.com:7051You can change to peer0, Org2 by running the following commands:export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.techracers.com/users/Admin@org2.techracers.com/mspexport CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org2.techracers.com:7051export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=\"Org2MSP\"export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.techracers.com/peers/peer0.org2.techracers.com/tls/ca.crtUse a similar strategy for other peers.updateMintingStateWe assume your config is set to peer0 of org1, otherwise set it using the following commands:export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.techracers.com/users/Admin@org1.techracers.com/mspexport CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.techracers.com:7051export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=\"Org1MSP\"export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.techracers.com/peers/peer0.org1.techracers.com/tls/ca.crtNow let\u2019s try to update our minting state to true.

During the course, she struggled to conceptualize what hyperbolic geometry looked like. At the time, she decided this subject wasn\u2019t for her and just tried to pass the class and forget about it.Years later, she found herself in a position where she would need to teach the same subject she struggled to make sense of. She was unwilling to leave her students as confused as she was and had the idea of turning to crochet to create the surface she needed. Through trial and error, she eventually found a pattern that created a hyperbolic surface.If you crochet in a round exponentially increasing the number of stitches per row, a hyperbolic surface is created.Building hyperbolic crochet with the number of stitches in each row dictated by 3*2^n where n is the number of rowsSince her discovery, hyperbolic crochet has increased in popularity due to the incredible sea urchin-esque shapes that can be made and the beauty of the shapes made.Note: This blog post and the crocheted objects made for it were based on material I learned from Dr. Taimina\u2019s Ted Talk and patterns shared by others inspired by her work. If you would like to read more, Dr. Taimina has also written a book on the topic.A brief explanation of hyperbolic planesThe definitions of hyperbolic geometry are complex. To avoid going down a rabbit hole outside of my expertise, I will link to the Wikipedia page and say that it is a realm of geometry where planes are no longer the familiar flat surfaces of Euclidean geometry but the curvy ever growing geometry of the crocheted objects above.A hyperbolic plane is a surface where the curvature at all points is negative. This can create saddle shapes or surfaces where the area grows as the radius increases. Here are some examples of hyperbolic planes in the real world:Pringles, Sea urchins and Mushrooms all have surfaces with negative curvature at all pointsExamples of Different CurvaturesA surface with negative curvature is the same as a concave surface. A surface with positive curvature is the same as a convex surface. The outside of a sphere is an example of a shape whose surface has positive curvature at all points. When curvature is neither positive or negative, a surface is flat, creating the Euclidean plane we\u2019re familiar with.Crochet can be used to represent surfaces with zero curvature at all points, surfaces with positive curvature at all points and surfaces with negative curvature at all points:A plane, a sphere and a hyperbolic plane show what zero curvature, positive curvature and negative curvature each look like.Relationships between Lines on a SurfaceZero Curvature SurfaceIf you recall back to middle school geometry, a pair of lines on a flat plane can either be parallel or intersecting. Parallel lines will stay the same distance apart going out in either direction forever.Parallel lines shown on a section of a surface with zero curvature represented by crochet and masking tapeIntersecting lines on the other hand will meet at one and only one point. Moving away from that point in either direction, the lines will be further and further apart.Intersecting lines shown on a section of a surface with zero curvature represented by crochet and masking tapePositive Curvature SurfaceAny line drawn on the surface of a sphere will eventually wrap around and meet itself, effectively creating a circle around that sphere. It may help you to imaging the behavior of straight lines on the surface of a sphere as lines drawn at the intersection point between a sphere and a flat plane.In blue we see the intersection of a flat plane and the sphere. On the flat plane, we see this intersection as a blue circle. On the sphere, the blue indicates a line that goes all the way around the surface.One way that lines on a sphere behave similarly to lines on a flat plane is that they can be parallel as shown below. If you again think of these lines as being created by flat planes in intersection with a curve, the planes creating parallel lines will be parallel planes.Left: parallel lines on a sphere represented by a crocheted sphere and masking tape lines. Right: Viewing a sphere and its intersection planes from the perspective perpendicular to the planes. Note that Plane1 is parallel to plane 2On a flat plane, lines can only intersect at one point. Moving away from that point, the lines grow increasingly further apart. On a sphere, however, because lines wrap around and meet again, they will only increase in distance apart until they reach a finite distance apart. After that, they will move closer together again until they meet again.Intersecting lines on a sphere also have similarities to intersecting lines on a flat plane. Lines will intersect at a point, then their distance apart increases as their distance from the point increases. In the case of a sphere, however, halfway between the two intersection points, the lines reach their maximum distance apart and then move closer to one another until they intersect at a second point. Intersecting lines on a sphere will always intersect at exactly two points.Left: Intersecting lines on a sphere represented by a crocheted sphere and masking tape lines. Right: Viewing a sphere and its intersection planes from the perspective perpendicular to the planes. Note that Plane1 intersects with Plane2. If we could see the other side of the sphere, we would see the second intersection point.It is also possible for lines on a sphere to be tangent to one another. Tangent lines will meet at only one point on a sphere\u2019s surface. At this point, they will come as close as possible to intersecting, but will never actually pass one another. The intersecting flat planes which create these lines meet at the surface of the sphere.Left: Tangent lines on a sphere represented by a crocheted sphere and masking tape lines.

Right: Viewing a sphere and its intersection planes from the perspective perpendicular to the planes. Note that Plane1 intersects with Plane2 intersect outside of the sphere.Note: The term antiparallel is distinct from the term intersecting because of surfaces with curvature. On flat planes with no curvature, lines that are antiparallel will always intersect.Negative Curvature SurfaceLines on a hyperbolic plane share the trait of lines on a flat plane of continuing to infinity without meeting themselves. Their behavior aside from this trait is quite different.The concept of parallelism on hyperbolic surfaces is complex. I initially understood it to not be possible for lines to be parallel on a hyperbolic surface because it is not possible to draw any two lines that remain equidistant apart on a hyperbolic surface. Dr. Taimina helpfully corrected this misunderstanding:[I]t is not correct to say that there are no parallel lines on hyperbolic plane \u2014 they are not parallel in Euclidean sense as equidistant but if we use a notion non-intersecting then there are two types of parallel lines.Looking at the lines shown below, they do not behave like parallel lines on a zero curvature plane because the are close for a region, but then they quickly move apart.There is also no such thing as lines that are tangent on a hyperbolic surface. The only other relationship lines can have on a hyperbolic surface is intersecting. Lines which intersect will only intersect at one point.Intersecting lines on a hyperbolic surface represented by a crocheted hyperbolic plane and masking tape lines.[1] Topology is a field of mathematics concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Physics", "Mathematics", "Science", "Education", "Math"]}, {"title": "Technical difference between Ethereum, Hyperledger fabric and R3 Corda", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@micobo/technical-difference-between-ethereum-hyperledger-fabric-and-r3-corda-5a58d0a6e347?source=search_post", "author_name": "micobo GmbH", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@micobo", "publish_date": "2018-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "12.7", "claps": 342, "voters": 64, "content": "Technical difference between Ethereum, Hyperledger fabric and R3 Cordamicobo GmbHFollowMar 16, 2018 \u00b7 13 min readThe major intention of this paper is to analyse the three Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda and provide an overview of the individual DLTs to users new to DLTs. The paper dives into the various aspects of the three DLTs, namely: the programming language used to create applications and contracts for the DLTs, their architecture, governance, smart contracts, consensus algorithm, scalability and privacy issues, currency and use cases, in order to showcase the major technical differences among the three DLTs.Ethereum was developed as a permissionless public Blockchain where anyone can write smart contracts and decentralised applications using the built in programming language called Solidity. The development of Ethereum was made independent of any specific field of application.Hyperledger fabric is a permissioned, shared ledger. The admission of participants are managed due to the permissioned nature of Hyperledger. The basic architecture of Hyperledger is based on multiple ledgers whose operations are independent of one another but there exists an addressing system that allows a transaction of one ledger to discover and utilise the transactions and smart contracts on another ledger. Hyperledger provides an extendable and modular architecture that can be employed for various fields and hence is made independent of any specific filed of application.R3 Corda is a Global Logical ledger in which all Economic actors interact allowing parties to record and manage agreements amongst themselves in a secure, consistent, reliable, private and authoritative manner. The word global in the global logical ledger is put in the sense that everyone sees the same data that pertains to them and the logical part is to signify that the physical implementation may be composed differently. Unlike Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, R3 Corda was developed solely envisioning the Financial industry.EthereumLanguageThe built in programming language for Ethereum is Solidity. It is a high level language for implementing smart contracts to be executed on the Ethereum Blockchain. The language is influenced by C++, Python and Java Scripts and is implemented on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The major advantage of solidity is its ease of understanding and implementation.A \u2019Go\u2019 implementation for writing Ethereum smart contracts is available but the contract written in golang cannot be directly implement them on the EVM. The programmer has to write his own compiler to convert the smart contracts in golang to EVM bytecode.ArchitectureEthereum, being an open and permissionless Blockchain, any developer can build an application using the inbuilt programming language to interact with the Blockchain. These applications care called Decentralized applications or Dapps. The users use these Dapps to interact with the blockchains. Miners create blocks in which user transactions are hashed and ordered. The node operators validate miner blocks and process users\u2019 transactions on those blocks.GovernanceThere is no centralised governance in Ethereum but is distributed among the various parties based on incentive. The Full Node operators decide which software their nodes will run. Miner operators decide whether to mine in a mining pool or to mine solo. Geth and Parity Codebases (command line interface used to run nodes) make their own decisions to maintain cross-client compatibility and have their representative developers attend the \u2018All devs\u2019 call where they have a direct conversation with the representatives of the Ethereum foundation.Smart ContractA smart contract is a computer protocol which is intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract between two or more network entities (nodes). The term \u2018contract\u2019 in Ethereum does not signify something that should be \u2018fulfilled\u2019 or \u2018complied with\u2019; rather an \u2018autonomous agent\u2019 living inside the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when triggered by a message or transaction. The code consists of a series of bytes, with each byte signifying an operation. The Smart Contracts in Ethereum run in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). An Ethereum transaction contract code can trigger data reads and writes, do computations like using cryptographic primitives, make calls (send messages) to other contracts, etc.ConsensusIn a Distributed Ledger Technology, consensus among the nodes must be reached to validate a transaction. The current instance of Ethereum uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. PoW uses a \u2018hash function\u2019 to create conditions. A participant solves the cryptographic puzzles and creates new blocks (mining). These blocks are then independently verified by other system participants.Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Casper implementation will introduce the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. The PoS algorithm is similar to the PoW system but the participants in the consensus building process is restricted to parties who have been identified to be having a legitimate stake in the Blockchain. The PoS removes the hash function calculation with a simple digital signature that proves ownership of stake. This would reduce distribution of information among nodes who have no legitimate stake in the Blockchain.ScalabilityEthereum is a permissionless, open-source Blockchain that operates on the PoW consensus algorithm. The participants involved in the consensus algorithm are not restricted and that leads to scalability issues for the network.The change to PoS algorithm would mean limited participants in the consensus algorithm, increasing the scalability of Ethereum.PrivacyThe permissionless nature of Ethereum means that, irrespective of legitimate stake in the Blockchain, a node involved in the consensus algorithm gets a copy of the transaction. This leads to privacy issues in the Ethereum Blockchain.Similar to the scalability issue, the change to PoS algorithm will also solve the privacy issue by restricting participation in the consensus algorithm.CurrencyAs discussed above, the smart contracts in Ethereum are executed in the EVM. Every single operation that are executed inside the EVM is simultaneously executed by every node in the network. The existence of gas, the internal pricing system for running a transaction or contract in Ethereum, is to limit the usage of resources by each contract. Each operation triggered by a contract based on cost measured in gas and each gas unit consumed by a transaction is paid for in Ether based on the current gas/Ether prices (this changes continuously).Use Case in FinanceDaimler has partnered with Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (LBBW) to sell a relatively short-term one-year bond to the savings banks Esslingen-N\u00fcrtingen, Ludwigsburg and Ostalb. The bond was issued on a private version of the Ethereum Blockchain.Hyperledger FabricLanguageContracts in Hyperledger are known as Chaincode. Hyperledger supports writing chaincode in Golang or Java language. The chaincode support for Java is in Beta. The chaincodes are finally executed inside a docker container.ArchitectureHyperledger facric is a blockchain framework implementation by the Linux Foundation.The permissioned nature of Hyperledger is created with the help of the issuing authority on the network. Validating and non-validating nodes are run by white listed organisations and transactors. These organisations and transactors are granted identity by the issuing authority. Depending on the purpose, the issuing authority assigns the appropriate level of access required to obtain an identity and transact on the network converting. Due to the varying level of access of each participants, Hyperledger is a permissioned ledger.The permissioned nature of Hyperledger arose from the need for privacy of operation for the participants. But the need for privacy does not exclude the need for identification and audit ability from regulators. Hence, the encryption of identity is done in such a way that it remains concealed from other unwanted participants but can be accessed by the regulators.Hyperledger starts with cryptographic certificate encapsulating a user\u2019s confidential data, which is registered in a registration authority. From each identity, the protocol can generate security keys for members to transact on a network, which conceal the identities of the transacting parties, providing privacy support to the network.Within Hyperledger, content confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the transactions such that only the stakeholders can decrypt and execute them. In addition, a piece of business logic (realised by a smart contract) can also be cryptographically secured (if confidentiality is required by its stakeholders) so that it only gets loaded and decrypted at runtime.GovernanceHyperledger is a private validator network protocol, meaning that all entities are required to register with membership services to obtain an identity with access and transaction authority on the network. During the network setup, validators can determine the level of permission that is required to transact. The Network set-up also defines the network as permissive, allowing ease of access and support for rapid and high adoption, or restrictive for a more controlled environment.Hyperledger fabric is a permissioned network, means that the control of governance lies with the Linux Foundation and the organisations within the blockchain.Smart Contract paradigmA chaincode is a decentralized transactional program, running on the validating nodes. Chaincode transactions are time bounded and configured during chaincode deployment, which is similar to a database call or a Web service invocation. If a transaction times out, it is considered as an error and will not cause state changes on the Ledger. One chaincode function can call another chaincode function if the callee has the same restrictive confidentiality scope\u037e that is, a confidential chaincode can call another confidential chaincode if they share the same group of validators.As transactions are run in a new block, a delta from the world state in the last block on the blockchain is maintained. If consensus is reached for the current block, the changes are committed to the database, and the world state block number is incremented by 1. If peers do not reach consensus, the delta is discarded and the database is not modified.ConsensusConsensus algorithms under Hyperledger are pluggable, allowing users to select the algorithm of their choice during deployment. The Hyperledger protocol will provide an implementation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) in its initial release, using the PBFT protocol [CL02].ScalabilityThe Hyperledger network structure is permissioned, controlling the number of participants in each Blockchain. The controlled number of participants increases the scalability of Hyperledger.PrivacyThe issuing authority of Hyperledger encrypts the identity of each user and the transactions made by the users. The encrypted data can only be decrypted at run-time by the required participants hence solving the privacy issues.CurrencyHyperledger Fabric does not have a native currency. A common attribute of a currency is that an amount will be transacted every time a transaction is processed on its chain. Based on the requirement of individual organisations, currencies on Hyperledger can be created using chaincodes.Use Case in FinanceHyperledger Fabric\u2019s trade finance platform aimed at international payments utilising Blockchain technology and are supported by Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Robobank, Societe Generale and Unicredit.R3 CordaLanguageThe code in Corda is written using Kotlin, a programming language from JetBeans that targets the JVM and Javascript. The major reason for chosing Kotlin is the high level of integration. Due to the JVM, any related programming paradigm can be used.ArchitectureThe major goal of corda is to create a \u2018global logical ledger\u2019 in which all economic actors will interact allowing parties to record and manage agreements amongst themselves in a secure, consistent, reliable, private and authoritative manner. The word global in the global logical ledger is put in the sense that everyone sees the same data that pertains to them and the logical part is to signify that the physical implementation may be composed differently. As such, a possible end-state is one in which we have moved from authoritative systems-of-record maintained within firms to global authoritative systems-of-record shared between firms making it not centralised by distributed.The architecture and strategic choices of corda for recording and proceeding financial agreements includes three major visions: firstly, records managed by this system will be accessible only to those actors with a legitimate interest in the assets and agreements they manage. Secondly, the behaviour of agreements managed by the system will be described in computer code that explicitly refers to and gains its legitimacy from over-arching legal prose. And finally, to gain wide adoption across the financial community, portions of the system must and will be open: open source, open development process, open, technological industry standards.The key activities or features of Corda, as stated in the Corda Whitepaper, includes:\u00b7 Recording and managing the evolution of financial agreements and other shared data between two or more identifiable parties in a way that is grounded in existing legal constructs and compatible with existing and emerging regulation.\u00b7 Choreographing work flow between firms without a central controller.\u00b7 Supporting consensus between firms at the level of individual deals, not a global system.\u00b7 Supporting the inclusion of regulatory and supervisory observer nodes.\u00b7 Validating transactions solely between parties to the transaction.\u00b7 Supporting a variety of consensus mechanisms.\u00b7 Recording explicit links between human-language legal prose documents and smart contract code.\u00b7 Using industry-standard tools.\u00b7 Restricting access to the data within an agreement to only those explicitly entitled or logically privileged to it.Corda began as a single global ledger. In case when the transaction involves a small subgroup of parties, corda strives to keep the relevant data purely within the subgroup.The foundation object is a state object that records the existence, content and current state of an agreement between two or more parties. It is intended to be shared only with those who have a legitimate reason to see it. To ensure consistency in a global, shared system where not all data is visible to all participants, Corda relies heavily on secured cryptographic hashes to identify parties and data. The ledger is defined as a set of immutable state objects.The modularity and interoperability of Corda enables organisations to integrate already existing setup, such as databases, into the Corda network.GovernanceCorda is a permissioned blockchain which gives the control of Governance to R3 and the organisations participating in the transaction.Smart ContractCorda supports smart contracts. Smart contracts in Corda are agreement whose execution is both automatable by computer code working with human input and control, and whose rights and obligations, as expressed in a legal prose, are legally enforceable. The smart contract links business logic and business data to an associated legal prose in order to ensure that the financial agreements on the platform are rooted firmly in law and can be enforced in the event of ambiguity, uncertainty or dispute.Corda enforces business logic through smart contract code, which is constructed as a pure function that either accepts or rejects a transaction, and which can be composed from simpler, reusable functions.Contracts define a part of the business logic on the ledger, and they are mobile: Nodes will download and run contracts inside a sandbox without any review in some deployments, although Corda envisages the use of signed code for Corda deployments in the regulated sphere.The virtual machine selected for contract execution and validation is the Java Virtual Machine. However, virtual machine has been augmented with a custom sandbox that is radically more restrictive than the ordinary JVM sandbox, and it enforces not only security requirements but also deterministic execution.ConsensusIn Corda, there are two aspects of consensus:\u00b7 Transaction validity: parties can reach certainty that a proposed update transaction defining output states is valid by checking that the associated contract code runs successfully and has all the required signatures; and that any transactions to which this transaction refers are also valid.\u00b7 Transaction uniqueness: parties can reach certainty that the transaction in question is the unique consumer of all its input states. That is: there exists no other transaction, consensus have been reached (validity and uniqueness), that consumes any of the same states.Parties can agree on transaction validity by independently running the same contract code and validation logic.A notary is a network service providing uniqueness consensus for a given transaction. Notary provides the point of finality in the system. Parties cannot be sure that an equally valid, but conflicting transaction is regared as a valid attempt to spend the given input state until the notary signature is obtained. Each state has an appointed notary, and the notary will only notarise the transaction if it is the appointed notary of all the transaction\u2019s input states.Corda has \u2018pluggable\u2019 uniqueness services. This is to improve privacy, scalability, legal-system compatibility and algorithmic agility. A single service may be composed of many mutually non-trusting nodes coordinating via a byzantine fault tolerant algorithm, or could be very simple, like a single machine. In some cases, like when evolving a state requires the signatures of all relevant parties, there may be no need for a uniqueness service at all.These uniqueness services are required only to attest whether the states consumed by a given transaction have previously been consumed; they are not required to attest as to the validity of the transaction itself, which is a matter for the parties to the transaction. This means that the uniqueness services are not required to (and, in the general case, will not) see the full contents of any transactions, significantly improving privacy and scalability of the system compared with alternative distributed ledger and blockchain designs. This design decision represents an important choice as to the acceptable trade-offs in shared ledger architectures.Scalability and PrivacyThe pluggable uniqueness service in Corda and the use of shared cryptographic hashes to ensure restrictive viewing of transactions tackle the scalability and privacy issues.CurrencyCorda does not have an internal currency but will support currencies in the future.Use Case in FinanceA group of 11 banks have developed a trade finance application on Corda. The application aims at smoothing the process for letters of credit. The banks involved include Bangkok Bank, BBVA, BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho, RBS, Scotiabank, SEB and U.S. Bank.\u2018Code is Law\u2019All executions is Ethereum is final. All the transactions are immutable. Even in case of conflicts and disagreements between two parties, the transaction cannot be reverted.Corda has a roll back function. If there is an accidental error, the incorrect data can be presented to a non validating notary that can roll back the transaction.In case of Hyperledger Fabric, no clear information is available regarding the approach taken to resolve conflicts.SummaryEthereum and Hyperledger fabric are flexible whereas Corda was designed specifically keeping the Financial Industry in focus. Ethereum\u2019s programming language Solidity was designed to be easily understandable and simple for implementation. But Ethereum\u2019s permissionless mode of operation and simplicity of understanding of Solidity leads to scalability and privacy issues. Fabric solves performance scalability and privacy issues by permissioned mode of operation and specifically by using a BFT algorithm and fine-grained access control. Corda, designed specifically for the finance industry tackles the issues of privacy and scalability but reaching a consensus on the participants involved in the transaction level and not inside the distributed ledger level making it better suited for the Financial industry.RemarksIf you like this article, we would be happy if you forward it to your colleagues or share it on social media.The Author Shourya Shirsha Nandi is a FinTech Analyst for micobo GmbH.micobo GmbH is a management consulting, specialised research and software development company with an existing track record in Distributed Ledger Technology.For any queries please contact us at FinTech@micobo.comReferences1. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper2. https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf3. https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-introductory-whitepaper.pdf4. https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf5. https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.20/6. https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum7. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go8. https://kotlinlang.org/9. https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f0510. https://dickolsson.com/how-governance-works-for-the-ethereum-blockchain/11. https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/10/02/a-gentle-introduction-to-ethereum/12. https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/09/06/abcs-of-open-governance13. https://www.coindesk.com/daimlers-e100-million-ethereum-bond-bigger-mercedes-benz/14. https://www.hyperledger.org/industries/finance15. https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/28/bank-based-blockchain-projects-are-going-to-transform-the-financial-services-industry/16. https://www.coindesk.com/11-banks-develop-dlt-trade-finance-app-using-r3s-corda-software/17. https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-09-09-code-is-law/", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Fintech", "Corda", "Hyperledger Fabric", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Optimizing Hyperparameters in Random Forest Classification", "post_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/optimizing-hyperparameters-in-random-forest-classification-ec7741f9d3f6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reilly Meinert", "author_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/@reillymeinert", "publish_date": "2019-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-07", "readtime": "7.20", "claps": 538, "voters": 63, "content": "Optimizing Hyperparameters in Random Forest ClassificationWhat hyperparameters are, how to choose hyperparameter values, and whether or not they\u2019re worth your timeReilly MeinertFollowJun 5 \u00b7 8 min readIn this post, I will be taking an in-depth look at hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest Classification models using several of scikit-learn\u2019s packages for classification and model selection. I will be analyzing the wine quality datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For the purpose of this post, I have combined the individual datasets for red and white wine, and assigned both an extra column to distinguish the color of the wine, where 0 represents a red wine and 1 represents a white wine. The purpose of this classification model is to determine whether a wine is red or white. In order to optimize this model to create the most accurate predictions, I will be focusing solely on hyperparameter adjustment and selection.What is a hyperparameter?Most generally, a hyperparameter is a parameter of the model that is set prior to the start of the learning process. Different models have different hyperparameters that can be set. For a Random Forest Classifier, there are several different hyperparameters that can be adjusted. In this post, I will be investigating the following four parameters:n_estimators: The n_estimators parameter specifies the number of trees in the forest of the model. The default value for this parameter is 10, which means that 10 different decision trees will be constructed in the random forest.2. max_depth: The max_depth parameter specifies the maximum depth of each tree. The default value for max_depth is None, which means that each tree will expand until every leaf is pure. A pure leaf is one where all of the data on the leaf comes from the same class.3. min_samples_split: The min_samples_split parameter specifies the minimum number of samples required to split an internal leaf node. The default value for this parameter is 2, which means that an internal node must have at least two samples before it can be split to have a more specific classification.4. min_samples_leaf: The min_samples_leaf parameter specifies the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. The default value for this parameter is 1, which means that every leaf must have at least 1 sample that it classifies.More documentation regarding the hyperparameters of a RandomForestClassifier() can be found here.How do you adjust hyperparameters?Hyperparameters can be adjusted manually when you call the function that creates the model.forest = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1, n_estimators = 10, min_samples_split = 1)How do you choose which hyperparameters to adjust?Prior to beginning the adjustment of the hyperparameters, I performed an 80/20 train/test split on my data. The different hyperparameters would be tested on the training set, and once the optimized parameter values were chosen, a model would be constructed using the chosen parameters and the testing set, and then would be tested on the training set to see how accurately the model is able to classify the types of wine.forest = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1)modelF = forest.fit(x_train, y_train)y_predF = modelF.predict(x_test)When tested on the training set with the default values for the hyperparameters, the values of the testing set were predicted with an accuracy of 0.991538461538.Validation CurvesThere\u2019s a few different ways you can choose which hyperparameters to adjust for you model. A good way to visually check for potentially optimized values of model hyperparameters is with a validation curve. A validation curve can be plotted on a graph to show how well a model performs with different values of a single hyperparameter. The following code was run to create the four validation curves seen here, with the values of param_name and param_range being adjusted accordingly for each of the four parameters that we are investigating.train_scoreNum, test_scoreNum = validation_curve(                                RandomForestClassifier(),                                X = x_train, y = y_train,                                 param_name = 'n_estimators',                                 param_range = num_est, cv = 3)This validation curve was created with the values [100, 300, 500, 750, 800, 1200] as the different values to be tested for n_estimators. In this image, we see that, when testing the values, the best value appears to be 750. It is important to note that, even though there appears to be a large difference between the training and cross-validation score, the training set had an average accuracy of 100% for each of the three cross-validations, and the cross-validation set had between 99.5% and 99.6% accuracy for all the values of n_estimators, which shows that this model is very accurate regardless of the number of estimators used.In this graph, we see that the highest accuracy value on the cross-validation is close to 99.3% when the max_depth is set to 15, which is the value that we will place in our model. Whole it may seem better to choose a max_depth of 30, because that value has the highest accuracy for the training score, we elect not to in order to prevent our model from overfitting the training data.In this graph, we see that the accuracy actually goes down for both the training and cross-validation sets at higher values for min_samples_split, so we will choose 5 as our number for min_samples_split. In this case, it makes sense that we would want a lower value for min_samples_split, as the default value for this parameter is 2. As we choose higher values for the minimum number of samples required before splitting an internal node, we will have more general leaf nodes, which would have a negative affect on the overall accuracy of our model.In this graph, we see that accuracy goes down for both the training and cross-validation sets for each additional increase in value of min_samples_leaf, so we will chose 1 for the value of our parameter, which again makes sense considering the default value for this parameter is 1.It is important to note that, when constructing the validation curves, the other parameters were held at their default values. For the purpose of this post, we will be using all of the optimized values together in a single model. A new Random Forest Classifier was constructed, as follows:forestVC = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1,                                  n_estimators = 750,                                  max_depth = 15,                                   min_samples_split = 5,  min_samples_leaf = 1) modelVC = forestVC.fit(x_train, y_train) y_predVC = modelVC.predict(x_test)This model resulted in an accuracy of 0.993076923077, which was more accurate than our first model, but only by .0015.Exhaustive Grid SearchAnother way to choose which hyperparameters to adjust is by conducting an exhaustive grid search or randomized search. Randomized searches will not be discussed in this post, but further documentation regarding their implementation can be found here.An exhaustive grid search takes in as many hyperparameters as you would like, and tries every single possible combination of the hyperparameters as well as as many cross-validations as you would like it to perform. An exhaustive grid search is a good way to determine the best hyperparameter values to use, but it can quickly become time consuming with every additional parameter value and cross-validation that you add.n_estimators = [100, 300, 500, 800, 1200]max_depth = [5, 8, 15, 25, 30]min_samples_split = [2, 5, 10, 15, 100]min_samples_leaf = [1, 2, 5, 10] hyperF = dict(n_estimators = n_estimators, max_depth = max_depth,                min_samples_split = min_samples_split,              min_samples_leaf = min_samples_leaf)gridF = GridSearchCV(forest, hyperF, cv = 3, verbose = 1,                       n_jobs = -1)bestF = gridF.fit(x_train, y_train)The code shown here took over 25 minutes to run, but did choose hyperparameters that had 100% accuracy in predicting the training models. The resulting \u201cbest\u201d hyperparameters are as follows: max_depth = 15, min_samples_leaf = 1, min_samples_split = 2, n_estimators = 500.Again, a new Random Forest Classifier was run using these values as hyperparameters inputs.forestOpt = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1, max_depth = 15,     n_estimators = 500, min_samples_split = 2, min_samples_leaf = 1)                                   modelOpt = forestOpt.fit(x_train, y_train)y_pred = modelOpt.predict(x_test)This model also resulted in an accuracy of 0.993076923077 when tested using the testing set.Is adjusting hyperparameters worth it?Carefully and methodically adjusting hyperparameters can be advantageous. It can make your classification model more accurate, which will lead to more accurate predictions overall. However, it may not always be worth your while. Let\u2019s take a look at the results of our different tests:The biggest thing to note is the overall improvement in accuracy. The hyperparameters chosen based on the results of the grid search and validation curve resulted in the same accuracy when the model was applied to our testing set: 0.993076923077. This improved our original model\u2019s accuracy on the testing set by .0015. Considering it took over 25 minutes to run the exhaustive grid search on our 4 desired hyperparameters, it may not have been worth the time in this case. Additionally, two of the \u201coptimized\u201d hyperparameter values given to us by our grid search were the same as the default values for these parameters for scikit-learn\u2019s Random Forest Classifier. When looking at the confusion matrices for each of the two optimized models, we see that both resulted in the same number of incorrect predictions for both red and white wines, as shown here:ConclusionHyperparameter tuning can be advantageous in creating a model that is better at classification. In the case of a random forest, it may not be necessary, as random forests are already very good at classification. Using exhaustive grid search to choose hyperparameter values can be very time consuming as well. However, in cases where there are only a few potential values for your hyperparameters or when your initial classification model isn\u2019t very accurate, it might be a good idea to at least investigate the effect of changing some of the hyperparameter values in your model.Key Terms/Ideas: hyperparameters, validation curve, exhaustive grid search, cross-validation", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Data Science", "Random Forest", "Parameter Tuning", "Classifcation Models"]}, {"title": "Simple blockchain network with Hyperledger Composer", "post_link": "https://blog.softwaremill.com/simple-blockchain-network-with-hyperledger-composer-637291b6b0ef?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tomasz Szyma\u0144ski", "author_link": "https://blog.softwaremill.com/@szimano", "publish_date": "2019-01-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-03", "readtime": "12.3", "claps": 230, "voters": 61, "content": "Simple blockchain network with Hyperledger ComposerTomasz Szyma\u0144skiFollowJan 3 \u00b7 13 min readHyperledgerThis blog is meant to explain the differences between various types of blockchains. You might have heard about public, permissioned or private blockchain before, but what does that really mean?Once this is settled, I will show you how to create your own permissioned network using Hyperledger Composer.MotivationThere are two main reasons for this blog. One is that at SoftwareMill we are creating custom blockchain solutions for clients around the world and we explore all technical possibilities out there in order to be able to always provide the best solution available.The second reason is that SoftwareMill\u2019s team, which I had the pleasure to be part of, won HackYeah PKN Orlen\u2019s challenge which the main goal was a development of loyalty program on the blockchain. We have chosen Hyperledger Composer and I wanted to share our experience.Private vs Permissioned vs Public BlockchainPublic BlockchainBTCThis is something we know and love (we love it, right? ;-) ). It is hard to find someone who has not heard about Bitcoin before. Most of the people heard about Ethereum as well. And You, my dear reader, have heard about them as well, I am sure!Public blockchain is \u201csimple\u201d \u2014 it is a decentralized ledger on which you can write information. Every participant is equal (just like under communism \u2014 everyone is equal, except some people own most of the money ;-) ). Everyone, given they have enough built-in currency (like BTC or ETH), can send transactions anywhere and the optional smart contract executed by the transaction might optionally stop/modify the execution.Public blockchain is, in theory, very safe. The more participants the network has, the more difficult it is to tamper with it. The built-in currencies are used as the incentive for the participants to join the network \u2014 if they commit their computing power, they might get some of the currency back as a reward.You need to, of course, remember that even with modern sophisticated algorithms, the consensus protocols are liable for attacks, the smart contracts might have bugs which can be used to perform an attack so you are never 100% safe. Additionally, because the network is public, all information saved there is accessible to everyone.Private BlockchainPrivate blockchain has an owner that has full access to the ledger and in theory can tamper with whatever is stored in it. So in that sense the ledger is not truly decentralized, but it is using the mathematical theory behind the public blockchain to create a safe implementation of a database.The participants of the private blockchain have to be invited and verified by the network owner.This is a good solution for parties that are in agreement but are not in full trust between each-other. A good example here might be a supply chain.Permissioned BlockchainFinally, what You came for. The permissioned blockchain. It is something between the private and the public one. There is an admin of the network, the participants might be invited, but it can also be open to the public if the admin chooses so.The participants of the network can be given specific permissions with different levels of access to different parts on the network. This will be cleared when you see examples from the Hyperledger Composer in the following sections.TL;DRTo sum it up \u2014 if you need true decentralization and it\u2019s difficult to gain trust from the users of your product \u2014 take a look at the public blockchain. If you want a secure database and your business needs to be \u201con the blockchain\u201d (wink wink) \u2014 look at the private one. If you need a little bit of both \u2014 then permissioned might be the way to go.HyperledgerNow that we know, more or less, what are the dissimilarities between the various flavors of blockchain, let us take a look at the Hyperledger.But what is Hyperledger?It is an umbrella for many blockchain-related projects under The Linux Foundation. Right now, since no-one has not came up with The Right Use of Blockchain yet, there are thousands of companies investing gazillions of dollars, to be the first ones. And if you check out the Hyperledger website you will see all the big brands who are supporting the projects (in both money and engineering powers).There are two projects we will look into today.Hyperledger FabricFabric is our blockchain. You can deploy nodes on the cloud or locally, using Docker or in bare JavaScript environment (node.js).It has a fully customizable consensus algorithms, you can invite participants and give them specific access to parts of your network.The assets on the network can be accessed via a JSON-based query language that is quite powerful.You can connect to it from various APIs in various computer languages.Hyperledger ComposerFabric can do a lot, but for simple applications or PoCs you do not need to be on such a low level.And here comes the Hyperledger Composer \u2014 a set of tools designed for rapid development of a blockchain network. It provides you with a DSL to specify the assets, the participants and the transactions. Smart contracts then are written in the lingua franca of today\u2019s computer languages \u2014 the JavaScript :).But how does it look like and what can we do with it?Merchant NetworkOk, now, what are we trying to do? Our business case is quite simple \u2014 we will write a very naive implementation of asset tokens.You can read more about them on our blog, but in layman terms those are tokens which are issued for a specific asset (yep :) I know \u2014 shocking!). The difference from other token types is that they kinda represent a share on a very specific item. It is not a share of business that sells art, but a share in a specific art piece.It has ups and downs \u2014 if you own a share in the art selling business you will receive a dividend based on an average selling margins. But if you own a share in a specific art piece, if it performs \u2014 you might get very, very rich. If it does not \u2014 you might make nothing (or actually loose money).There will be two actors on our network.A Merchant \u2014 vetted by \u201cour\u201d company / owner of the blockchain, to make sure only real merchants can offer Mona Lisas and Sunflowers. They can list an art work on our system, issue tokens for it and name them. A merchant might decide to sell the art, removing it from the system.A Person \u2014 our main user that will buy tokens for a specific art works and will be able to either agree to sell the work or not, when merchant calls for it.What is important \u2014 we are just implementing the \u201cstorage\u201d part of our system. Our solution will expose transactions via REST services that will have to be used by some other software that will implement the exchange of tokens, auctions of art works, user registration, merchant vetting etc. etc. etc. We will just provide a way to store all data on the blockchain.Bootstrap the NetworkFirst thing you need to do is to make sure the Hyperledger Composer and Fabric are working on your machine. Simply follow this user guide.Once this is set up, create a new network by typing yo hyperledger-composer:businessnetwork. Call the network merchant-network and for the package use org.szimano.merchantnetwork (or whatever you prefer, just remember to update package name in the following examples).ModelOnce the network is bootstrapped, we can start writing the business logic. First thing we\u2019re gonna write is the model. It consists of four things:Participants that represent the actors of our system, but also provide granular access to it (when you connect to the blockchain you will be identified as one of the actors on the system).Assets which are the entities stored on the chain.Transactions which are the operations on the assets.Events that can be emitted during transactions for your applications to listen on.The model file will start with the namespace defined.So now let us start with the assets then. First one will be a very simple actor called Person.Every asset has to have a primary key and we have added a name field. Fields are marked with o at the beginning.The second actor will be our Merchant.It extends the Person, so we do not need to specify the primary key (it will be inherited) and there is no extra information we need to store about the Merchant except them being the Merchant :)Once the participants are settled, we will need to define our assets.The first one will be the art work itself.You can see there are two new things \u2014 keyword asset and a new ascii art arrow --> meaning a relation. The assets also needs a primary key plus we have added a description field on which we will store a human readable description of the art work.Once we have the art, we can create an art token.Those tokens have names, they are bound to an art work plus they are owned by a Person (which can be both Merchant and regular Person). The onSale, defaulted to false, will be used by the Person to mark their tokens as \"ready to sale\".The assets are in place, now we need the transactions that will trigger the actions on our network.First one is the transaction during which a Merchant will be able to list an art on the system.Once the art is listed, we need a way of sending tokens between the users.And finally, the merchant needs to have a way of selling the art work.Now, when the model is ready, we need to implement how the system will run on top of it.QueriesIn the project root create a queries.qry file - you can define named queries that will use a SQL-like language. In our case we will need two - the ability to select all tokens for a given art and a given token owner:and a second one to get all tokens for a given art:If you know SQL (and I am pretty sure you do), the above looks very familiar. The _$VAR is a notation for passing external parameters to the query (more on the usage of those later).Smart Contract (aka logic.js)Now, that we have all the bits and pieces in place, we can create our \u201csmart contract\u201d that will list the art work on our system, issue tokens for it and assign them all to the merchant.You need to start with a specially prepared comment with annotations (like xdocklet in Java that I was using when I started my first job 12 years ago :D ).Our method takes one parameter which is the transaction that we want it to process. It will be marked with @param annotation, followed by a fully qualified type of the transaction. It will return a string, which we have to mark with @returns annotation. And finally, since this is a transaction processor, we need to mark it with @transaction annotation.Then another transaction to send tokens between users:In this method, we are sending tokens between two participants.One thing worth noticing is that in code block [1] we are using a query. The difference here is that instead of passing the actual object as a parameter we need to create a special string pointing to the resource that has a form of: resource:{FULLY_QUALIFIED_TYPE}#{ID}. In our example we need to pass a Person resource, but since this can be either a Person or Merchant (which inherits from Person) we cannot just hard-code the namespace. Instead, we are calling getFullyQualifiedType() on the sender object which will give us what we need (either org.szimano.merchantnetwork.Merchant for Merchant or org.szimano.merchantnetwork.Person for Person). Remember that a Person with a given ID is a different resource then a Merchant with the same ID. Inheritance here is very limited!Once [7] is executed, the owner of the ArtToken will be changed and the sender user will no longer have access to them.The final transaction is for selling the art. To make it easier, we are just writing the transaction on the blockchain to mark that the art has been sold. The tokens are not then removed from it \u2014 this is something that could be done in further network development.What we are going to use is the onSale field that is set to false by default. Every owner of an asset token can mark its onSale to true which means that he or she is ready to sell the art. Once at least 50% of the tokens for a given art work are set as onSale = true then our network will allow creating a sale transaction.PermissionsSince this is a permissioned blockchain we need a way of describing the permissions.They all have to have:a unique rule namedescriptionparticipant \u2014 for whom should the rule be evaluated (connected user to the blockchain)operation \u2014 a mix of READ, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE and ALLresource \u2014 for which asset or participant on the blockchain should the rule be evaluatedaction \u2014 either ALLOW or DENYtransaction /optional/ \u2014 inside which transaction should this rule be evaluatedcondition /optional/ \u2014 a logic that can bind the participant, asset and transaction (see below)The participant and resource can be followed by #{ID} to specify a specific instance, e.g. org.szimano.merchantnetwork.Merchant#szimano1.Let us start with a simple ACL allowing all participant reading all data on Persons.Then, we will allow creating and reading ListArtWork transaction by Merchants, but we will use the condition field to make sure that the Merchant lists only own art works.Then, let us allow Merchant selling art work, but again making sure he sells only art listed by them.Finally, we will allow the network admin to fully control everything. Permissions are good but this is our network! ;-)Build and run your networkFinally, once all is done, we need to run a few magic commands in the terminal.Run FabricGiven that you followed the composer installation guide, just type~/fabric-dev-servers/startFabric.shBuildFirstly, create a new archive. The first command will produce a BNA file which is a full definition of our network (models, transactions, ACLs and all).The second command will import the networkadmin card, so that we can connect to the network as an admin (we can create network cards for specific participants of our blockchain \u2014 you can read more about it in the Hyperledger Documentation). You will have to do this only once.composer archive create -t dir -n .composer card import --file networkadmin.cardDeployOnce the network is created, we need to install it and then run. Make sure the 0.0.2 version used in the commands reflects your network version number.composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile merchant-network@0.0.2.bnacomposer network start --networkName merchant-network --networkVersion 0.0.2 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file networkadmin.cardUpgradingWhen your network is up and running instead of starting it you need to upgrade. Bump your version (let us say to 0.0.3 for the sake of the example) in package.json and then:composer archive create -t dir -n . - create a new archivecomposer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile merchant-network@0.0.3.bna - install itcomposer network upgrade --networkName merchant-network --networkVersion 0.0.3 --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 - upgrade network to the new versionThere are a few rules when upgrading your model (it has to be backward compatible) \u2014 you can read more about Model Compatibility in the Hyperledger Compose docs.Expose REST endpointsTo make REST endpoints available for the outside world, type the following in the project directory:composer-rest-serverUse admin@merchant-network cardChoose never use namespacesChoose default options for the restCheck it outGo to http://localhost:3000/explorer to see everything works as expected.Now, that all is up and running, you can start calling our network via the REST services.Word on testingFinally, if you take a look at the test file, you can see how one can set up integration tests that spin up a locally running hyperledger network which then gives you the opportunity to test your models/transactions/ACLs etc.Just to get a glimpse on how can it look like, below you can see one of the tests, checking that a happy path of artwork listing works.SummaryTL;DR \u2014 we have just created a very naive and simple blockchain for storing asset tokens on Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Composer.Our network consists of participants, which are both actors of our system and also potential users who can connect to the network and issue transactions; assets, which are items stored on the network; transactions, which represent actions on the network and ACLs that define who can perform what.Hyperledger Composer provides an integrated development network for very fast time-to-market blockchain solutions. It leverages few very simple DSLs and a commonly used JavaScript language. It allows not only designing the network, but also a very robust testing framework.Once the network is up and running, your application can connect via many APIs and REST endpoints that are auto-generated/documented for you.Questions or concerns?

When you are looking for a pair of shoes to buy, you are solving a hyper-parameter optimization problem. Once you have decided which type of shoes you are going to buy (hyper-parameter) you need to fit the parameters of the shoes to meet your requirements (size, colour,\u2026). Your available budget is also a hyper-parameter that will affect your choices.An everyday hyper-parameter optimization problemHyper-parameter tuningIf you chose a pair of shoes that fits you and is the right colour you will be able to wear them. However, you might find running a marathon challenging if you chose a pair of red stilettos. Hyper-parameter tuning might not be critical for most use cases but can significantly affect the efficiency of your processes and the quality of the results you are trying to obtain (e.g. you can run in boots but you might not run as fast as with trainers).Hyper-parameter tuning in Data ScienceMost Machine Learning models have hyper-parameters.For example, a simple random forest algorithm will have quite a few:Scikit-Learn implementation of a Random Forest ClassifierOnce a user has specified the values of its hyper-parameters, the algorithm will be trained on the underlying data set. The choice of the hyper-parameters will affect the duration of the training and the accuracy of the predictions. Unfortunately, choosing hyper-parameters isn\u2019t straight forward as the number of possible configurations explodes with their number and the evaluation time of a configuration is function of the complexity of the model and the size of the underlying training data. Moreover, it is a bit of a dark art and as William Koehrsen put perfectly in his Medium article:Hyperparameter tuning relies more on experimental results than theory, and thus the best method to determine the optimal settings is to try many different combinations evaluate the performance of each model.With so much uncertainty it is understandable that most Data Scientists forego hyper-parameter tuning and stick with the default values provided by the model. This works in most cases, but to pick up on my introductory analogy, you might struggle to run a marathon in stilettos.You wouldn\u2019t do it in real life (unless it was for a good cause), so why would you in Data Science?The second most popular approach is to find the optimal configuration through grid-search (evaluating every single configuration) which will evantually lead to an answer.But you wouldn\u2019t run a marathon with every single pair of shoes you own to conclude that you get the best results with trainers, so why would you do the same in Data Science?The third most popular approach is to find the optimal configuration through random-search, but this is only marginally better than grid-search. I\u2019ll spare you with an analogy for this one as I hope by now you see my point.So how can hyper-parameter tuning be done more efficiently?Mind Foundry\u2019s Twitter followers seem to know the answerBayesian OptimizationBayesian Optimization addresses the pitfalls of grid and random search by incorporating a \u201cbelief\u201d of what the solution space looks like, and by \u201clearning\u201d from the configurations it evaluates. This belief can be specified by a domain expert but can also be flat at the beginning. If and when you try to run a marathon in stilettos, you won\u2019t try it again with every other pair of stilletos you own because you will have learnt that it\u2019s painful. Moreover, if you had prior knowledge, you might have chosen flat soled shoes right from the beginning!I have written a more detailed article (with less analogies) explaining the intuitions behing Bayesian Optimization here:The intuitions behind Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian ProcessesIn certain applications the objective function is expensive or difficult to evaluate.

Anything, with hyper in the name sounds cool enough, but what does it actually do and why should you care?Every machine learning algorithm has a certain number of parameters that you define before you start training. The number of layers, depth of a tree or the amount of regularization are just some examples of such (hyper)parameters. Once those are defined you can feed the data to your model, train it and evaluate its performance.Hyperparameter optimization is just the process of tweaking hyperparameters to achieve the highest performance under some time constraint.Sounds simple? Well, it is\u2026 and it\u2019s not.The obvious approach is just to iterate over all possible combinations of hyperparameters, run a grid search. The problem with that is that usually there is not enough time in the universe to run it all.A better idea is to sample a limited number, say 100, randomly selected hyperparameter sets and try them all. In practice, this is usually good enough. But if you think about it, it is far from perfect. Some parts of the hyperparameter search space are just not worth your (and your GPU) time.Instead of selecting all 100 hyperparameter sets at the beginning, you could make a more informed decision, and select a set of hyperparameters based on the information you have at hand after every run. This is what people usually refer to as \u201cBayesian hyperparameter optimization\u201d and it will be the primary focus of this series.In this series, we will look at the major python HPO libraries, learn what they offer, how to use them and which one can get you the best results.About this studyEvaluation criteriaWe need some dimensions to compare those libraries and I decided to go with:Ease of use/setup and APIdocumentation and examplesoptions/methods/(hyper)hyperparameterspersistence/restartingspeed and parallelizationvisualizationsexperimental results**those should not be treated as a machine learning benchmark. I wanted to make sure that I can run those HPO experiments for different libraries on a simple problem and get some sort of intuition for the results.I will try to subjectively score each category from 0\u201310. For the experimental results, I will calculate the gain over random search strategy and use it as a score. Please comment if you agree/disagree with my judgment, we can definitely get a better guesstimate together!LibrariesGoing by popularity, I took the following libraries for a spin:Scikit-OptimizeHyperoptOptunahpbandsterBayesianOptimizationSherpaSMAC3If I am missing your favorite library, let me know, I will add it later!Example problemAs an example let\u2019s tweak the hyperparameters of the lightGBM model on a simple, binary, tabular dataset. To make the training quick I fixed the number of boosting rounds to 300 with a 30 round early stopping.All the training and evaluation logic is put inside thetrain_evaluatefunction. We can treat it as a black box that takes the data and hyperparameter set and produces the AUC evaluation score.Moreover, it makes it easy for you to follow this blog post with your own tabular data. You can change the evaluation metric too if you want to. I took a dataset from the recently finished Kaggle competition and took the first 10000 rows from it.To train a model on a set of MODEL_PARAMS you can run something like this:Tracking experiments and resultsI like to keep track of the experiments I run. Being able to come back to them at any time and share them with anyone makes me feel that this work is not lost. I tracked and managed my experimentation in Neptune. For every run I logged:scripts,hyperparameters,diagnostic charts,results objects (as pickles),best hyperparameters,AUC metrics,You can simply go to the blog-hpo project, explore all this information for every experiment and even download the results.Other notesA few other things that I feel you should know:I ran all the experiments on linux 16.04,Worked on 12 cores,Training budget was 100 iterations total.Now, that we have the prerequisites out of the way, we can finally start tweaking those hyperparameters.What\u2019s next?If you want to take a look at the first library, check out Part1: Scikit-Optimize.You can also go and read other posts from this series in my HPO in Python column.If you liked this, you can find more posts like this on our Neptune blog.You can also find me tweeting @NeptuneML or posting on LinkedIn about ML and Data Science stuff.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Data Science", "Hyperparameter", "Hyperparameter Tuning", "Hpo In Python"]}, {"title": "Tune: a Python library for fast hyperparameter tuning at any scale", "post_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/fast-hyperparameter-tuning-at-scale-d428223b081c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Richard Liaw", "author_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/@richliaw", "publish_date": "2019-08-18", "last_modified_date": "2019-10-21", "readtime": "6.55", "claps": 301, "voters": 54, "content": "Tune: a Python library for fast hyperparameter tuning at any scaleScale your search from laptop to hundreds of machines without changing your code. Check out Tune.Richard LiawFollowAug 18 \u00b7 7 min readIf you\u2019ve ever tried to tune hyperparameters for a machine learning model, you know that it can be a very painful process. Simple approaches quickly become time-consuming.And now more than ever, you absolutely need cutting-edge hyperparameter tuning tools to keep up with the state-of-the-art.Model advancements are becoming more and more dependent on newer and better hyperparameter tuning algorithms such as Population Based Training (PBT), HyperBand, and ASHA.Population-based Training improves DeepMind\u2019s state-of-the-art algorithms on many domains by significant margins. Source: https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks/These algorithms provide two critical benefits:They maximize model performance: e.g., DeepMind uses PBT to achieve superhuman performance on StarCraft; Waymo uses PBT to enable self-driving cars.They minimize training costs: HyperBand and ASHA converge to high-quality configurations in half the time taken by previous approaches; population-based data augmentation algorithms cuts costs by orders of magnitude.The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of researchers and teams do not leverage such algorithms. Most existing hyperparameter search frameworks do not have these newer optimization algorithms. And once you reach a certain scale, most existing solutions for parallel hyperparameter search can be a hassle to use \u2014 you\u2019ll need to configure each machine for each run and often manage a separate database.Practically speaking, implementing and maintaining these algorithms requires a significant amount of time and engineering.But it doesn\u2019t need to be this way. There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t easily incorporate hyperparameter tuning into your machine learning project, seamlessly run a parallel asynchronous grid search on 8 GPUs in your cluster, and leverage Population Based Training or any Bayesian optimization algorithm at scale on the cloud.In this blog post, we\u2019ll introduce Tune, a powerful hyperparameter optimization library designed to remove the friction from scaling experiment execution and hyperparameter search.Tune scales your training from a single machine to a large distributed cluster without changing your code.Tune is a powerful library that accelerates hyperparameter optimization. Here are some core features:Tune provides distributed asynchronous optimization out of the box.Tune offers state of the art algorithms including (but not limited to) ASHA, BOHB, and Population-Based Training.You can scale a Tune hyperparameter search from a single machine to a large distributed cluster without changing your code.Tune integrates with many optimization libraries such as Ax/Botorch, HyperOpt, and Bayesian Optimization and enables you to scale them transparently.Tune supports any machine learning framework, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn, and Keras.Beyond Tune\u2019s core features, there are two primary reasons why researchers and developers prefer Tune over other existing hyperparameter tuning frameworks: scale and flexibility.Note for Search Algorithms: as of 8/12/2019, HpBandSter supports HyperBand, Random Search, and BOHB. KerasTuner supports Random Search, HyperBand, and Bayesian Optimization. Optuna supports Median (Percentile) Stopping, ASHA, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization (TPE). HyperOpt supports Bayesian Optimization and Random Search. Tune supports PBT, BOHB, ASHA, HyperBand, Median Stopping, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization (TPE, etc), and numerous others due to library integrations.Tune simplifies scaling.Leverage all of the cores and GPUs on your machine to perform parallel asynchronous hyperparameter tuning by adding fewer than 10 lines of Python.If you run into an ImportError, try installing from a snapshot wheel: https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#trying-snapshots-from-masterhttps://twitter.com/MarcCoru/status/1080596327006945281With another configuration file and 4 lines of code, launch a massive distributed hyperparameter search on the cloud and automatically shut down the machines (we\u2019ll show you how to do this below).With Tune\u2019s built-in fault tolerance, trial migration, and cluster autoscaling, you can safely leverage spot (preemptible) instances and reduce cloud costs by up to 90%.Tune is flexible.Tune integrates seamlessly with experiment management tools such as MLFlow and TensorBoard.Tune provides a flexible interface for optimization algorithms, allowing you to easily implement and scale new optimization algorithms.You can use Tune to leverage and scale many state-of-the-art search algorithms and libraries such as HyperOpt (below) and Ax without modifying any model training code.Using Tune is Easy!Let\u2019s now dive into a concrete example that shows how you to leverage a state-of-the-art early stopping algorithm (ASHA). We will start by running Tune across all of the cores on your workstation. We\u2019ll then scale out the same experiment on the cloud with about 10 lines of code.We\u2019ll be using PyTorch in this example, but we also have examples for Tensorflow and Keras available.Tune is installed as part of Ray. To run this example, you will need to install the following: pip install ray torch torchvision.You can download a full version of the blog in this blog here.We first run some imports :header of `tune_script.py`Let\u2019s write a neural network with PyTorch:To start using Tune, add a simple logging statement to the PyTorch training below function.def train_mnist(config):    model = ConvNet()    train_loader, test_loader = get_data_loaders()    optimizer = optim.SGD(        model.parameters(),         lr=config[\"lr\"],         momentum=config[\"momentum\"])    for i in range(10):        train(model, optimizer, train_loader, torch.device(\"cpu\"))        acc = test(model, test_loader, torch.device(\"cpu\"))        tune.track.log(mean_accuracy=acc)        if i % 5 == 0:            # This saves the model to the trial directory            torch.save(model, \"./model.pth\")Notice that there\u2019s a couple helper functions in the above training script; you can see their definitions here.Running TuneLet\u2019s run 1 trial, randomly sampling from a uniform distribution for learning rate and momentum.Now, you\u2019ve run your first Tune run! You can easily enable GPU usage by specifying GPU resources \u2014 see the documentation for more details. We can then plot the performance of this trial.Parallel execution and early stoppingEarly stopping with ASHA.Let\u2019s integrate ASHA, a scalable algorithm for early stopping (blog post and paper). ASHA terminates trials that are less promising and allocates more time and resources to more promising trials.Parallelize your search across all available cores on your machine with num_samples (extra trials will be queued).You can use the same DataFrame plotting as the previous example. After running, if Tensorboard is installed, you can also use Tensorboard for visualizing results: tensorboard --logdir ~/ray_resultsGoing distributedSetting up a distributed hyperparameter search is often too much work. Tune and Ray make this seamless.Launching the cloud with a simple configuration fileLaunch a cluster and distribute hyperparameter search without changing your codeFirst, we\u2019ll create a YAML file which configures a Ray cluster. As part of Ray, Tune interoperates very cleanly with the Ray cluster launcher. The same commands shown below will work on GCP, AWS, and local private clusters. We\u2019ll use 3 worker nodes in addition to a head node, so we should have a total of 32 vCPUs on the cluster \u2014 allowing us to evaluate 32 hyperparameter configurations in parallel.tune-default.yamlPutting things togetherTo distribute your hyperparameter search across the Ray cluster, you\u2019ll need to append this to the top of your script:Given the large increase in compute, we should be able to increase our search space and number of samples in our search space:You can download a full version of the script in this blog here (as tune_script.py).Launching your experimentTo launch your experiment, you can run (assuming your code so far is in a file tune_script.py):$ ray submit tune-default.yaml tune_script.py --start \\     --args=\u201dlocalhost:6379\u201dThis will launch your cluster on AWS, upload tune_script.py onto the head node, and run python tune_script localhost:6379, which is a port opened by Ray to enable distributed execution.All of the output of your script will show up on your console. Note that the cluster will setup the head node first before any of the worker nodes, so at first you may see only 4 CPUs available. After some time, you can see 24 trials being executed in parallel, and the other trials will be queued up to be executed as soon as a trial is free.To shut down your cluster, you can run:$ ray down tune-default.yamlAnd you\u2019re done \ud83c\udf89!Learn more:Tune has numerous other features that enable researchers and practitioners to accelerate their development. Other Tune features not covered in this blogpost include:A simple API for running distributed fault-tolerant experimentsDistributed Hyperparameter search over Distributed Data Parallel training for PyTorchPopulation-based TrainingFor users that have access to the cloud, Tune and Ray provide a number of utilities that enable a seamless transition between development on your laptop and execution on the cloud.

Due to the large amounts of data being generated day after day, it could be used to train Deep Neural Networks and is preferred over traditional Machine Learning algorithms for higher performance and precision which has led to various successful commercial products.Even though Deep Learning has been a booming field, there are certain practical aspects of it which remains a black box like choosing the optimal hyperparameters for your Neural Networks.You need to understand that Applied Deep Learning is a highly iterative process. There are various hyperparameters you need to keep in your mind before training your model. It is almost impossible to get the correct values of hyperparameters as it requires years of experience and expertise and as well as extensive trial and error to find the optimal values for your model which becomes a huge problem for the people starting out in the field.In this guide, I\u2019m going to describe powerful and effective ways of choosing the optimal hyperparameters for your model. The hyperparameters are-Learning RateBatch SizeMomentumWeight DecayI am going the divide this guide into two parts. In this part, I will talk about the learning rate and the batch size.But before getting into hyperparameters, we need to cover some core concepts and tradeoffs which play a major role in the performance of the model and how the hyperparameters impact these concepts and it would help us to interpret the training process. After reading this post, you will understand the important machine learning concepts such as Bias-Variance tradeoff, Overfitting, and Underfitting and practical and effective ways of choosing the parameters which are -GeneralizationWe have trained a classification model on 10,000 images with their labels. We test the model out on the original dataset, it is able to predict labels with a mindblowing accuracy of 99%But when we try the same model on a new unseen dataset, we only get an accuracy of 50% and fails to performs well.This is the case of overfitting as our model wasn\u2019t able to generalize well on the unseen dataset.Our goal while training a network is to have it generalize well on the training data which means capturing the true signal of the data rather than memorizing the noise in the data. In statistics, it is termed as \u201cGoodness of Fit\u201d which refers to how well our predicted values match to the true (ground) values.ML is also you learning from the algorithm and getting it right!Bias-Variance TradeoffBias-Variance Tradeoff is one of the important aspects of Applied Machine Learning. It has simple and powerful implications around the model complexity and its performance.We say there\u2019s a bias in a model when the algorithm is not flexible enough to generalize well from the data. Linear parametric algorithms with low complexity such as Regression and Naive Bayes tend to have a high bias.Variance occurs in the model when the algorithm is sensitive and highly flexible to the training data. Non-Linear non-parametric algorithms with high complexity such as Decision trees, Neural Network, etc tend to have high variance.Bias vs VarianceSo, while training a model we need to keep in mind of this tradeoff because algorithms with high bias and a low variance perform well consistently but on the average, their accuracy is lower. Whereas, algorithms with low bias and high variance have better accuracy but are inconsistent and as well as this tradeoff depends on the dataset it\u2019s trained on.There are various ways to find the balance of bias and variance for each algorithm family by using methods such as regularization, pruning, etc.But in this post, I\u2019m going to only talk about finding the balance for the Neural Networks.Overfitting vs UnderfittingDo you know what\u2019s one mistake that could single handly ruin the performance of your model?It\u2019s one of the trickiest problems one faces in applied machine learning.It is Overfitting. Because, when your machine learning model is tested on the unseen data in the \u201creal\u201d world, it will come across data which wouldn\u2019t be in the training data. Therefore, it is necessary for the model to generalize well on the data.Algorithms overfit on the training data when it memorizes the noise instead of the data. Usually, complex algorithms such as Neural Networks are prone to overfitting.Algorithms underfit on the training data when it is not able to capture the true signal from the data. Underfitted models have bad accuracy in training as well as on the test data.We are going to talk more about it later and will see how choosing the optimal parameters helps in finding the right balance to get the right predictions which minimize total error.Gradient Descent AlgorithmsGradient Descent is one of the most popular and used algorithms for weights optimization of the models. Gradient Descent helps in minimizing the cost function by updating the parameters which are weights in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. It has a learning rate, a hyperparameter, which helps us control the adjustment of weights for our network to our loss gradient or in simpler terms, we can say the learning rate refers to the size of steps the gradient descent takes to reach the local optima. That\u2019s our goal to find the optimal weights. We will talk about choosing the right learning rate for our network later as it plays an important role.There are in total of three variants of Gradient Descent. They differ by the way they take data for computing the gradient of the cost function. There\u2019s a tradeoff over here depending upon the Gradient Descent variant we choose, which is the accuracy of the update of weights and the time it takes for each epoch i.e each iteration for the weights update.Search for local optima to get the best weightsOur main goal while training a neural network is to find the optimal weights to get accurate results. The distinct feature that makes Deep Learning better than traditional machine learning is the fact that we don\u2019t need to do any feature engineering.Weights are the parameters that we have no control on, we need to focus more on the network architecture, activation functions, and the hyperparameters which would help us find the optimal weights.Variants of GD AlgorithmLearning RateLearning Rate is a parameter of the Gradient Descent algorithm which helps us control the change of weights for our network to the loss of gradient.The training of your model will progress very slowly if you keep your learning rate low as it would be making tiny adjustments to the weights in the network and it could also lead to overfitting. Whereas, when you set a high learning rate, the parametric function tend to have kinetic energy which makes it take huge leaps bouncing around chaotically, not letting it get narrower and deeper missing the local optima making the training diverge. But having a large learning rate helps in regularizing the model well to capture the true signal.We can do a random grid search to find the optimal learning rate that converges but there are easier ways as it is computationally heavy and time-consuming.Learning Rate ScheduleThe Learning Rate Schedule helps to adjust the learning rate while the training process by changing the learning rate through a predefined schedule. There are three variants of learning rate schedules such as time-based decay, exponential decay, and step decay.Constant Learning RateWe can use the default learning rate while training the network, which we could use as a baseline to compare our performances and to get a rough idea of how the network is behaving. We can set the momentum and time decay as default which is zero.Adaptive Learning Rate MethodThe drawback of using learning rate schedules is that we have to predefine the learning rates before the training process but we couldn\u2019t choose the right ones with intuition as it depends totally on the model we have and the domain problem we are working on.There are variants of Gradient Descent Algorithms that are adaptive in nature such as Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam in which the learning rate adapts on the kind of data it is dealing with (sparse, less sparse, etc) and it doesn\u2019t require much of the manual work for tuning the learning rate.In the deep learning frameworks, we can easily implement the above adaptive optimizers. it is recommended to keep the hyperparameters for these optimizers as default.Cyclic Learning RateFor using Cyclic Learning Rate, we need to define the minimum and maximum learning rate boundaries with the step size. The step size here is the number of epochs(iterations) taken for each step. The cycle consists of two kinds of step \u2014 one that linearly increases from minimum to maximum and the one that linearly decreases.https://github.com/gaohuang/SnapshotEnsembleLearning rate Range testThe training of the network by using the learning rate range test starts with a small learning rate which then linearly increases. We can obtain valuable information from it by a single run as when we choose a small learning rate, the cost function tends to converge well hitting the optima, but while increasing the learning rate, we will come across a threshold from which the validation loss starts increasing and the accuracy drops. That's how we get an idea about the optimal learning rate for our model and dataThe amount of regularization we do should be balanced depending on the data and the model we are implementing.Batch SizeThe Batch Size refers to the number of training samples propagated through the network.For example, we have a training dataset of 1000 sample and if we set a batch size of 100, the network will consider every 100 samples for the training but process every epoch.While practicing deep learning, it is our goal to obtain the maximum performance by minimizing the computational time required. While the value of the hyperparameter learning rate doesn\u2019t affect the training time but the batch size does.How Batch size impacts the performanceSome papers recommend using a larger batch size which could be supported by your system\u2019s memory. Some also suggest modifying the batch size rather than changing the learning rate. However, a larger batch size enables using a large learning rate. Larger batch sizes tend to have low early losses while training whereas the final loss values are low when the batch size is reduced.In part two of this guide, I will cover momentum and weight decay as well as the code to reproduce the results.
