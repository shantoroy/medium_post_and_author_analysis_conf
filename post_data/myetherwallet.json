Does MEW still exist? Does MEW have a new team already in place to respond to any user issues or questions? Are there new features and services forthcoming?Well, I won\u2019t leave you in suspense any longer. Simply put, the answers to all of the above questions are a resounding, \u201cYES!\u201d If you would like to continue reading, you will find more detailed responses below.Does MEW still exist?Yes! MyEtherwallet remains an independent company. We have not disbanded or rebranded, and have no affiliation with MyCrypto. The truth is, more often than not, two-person business partnerships don\u2019t last forever. This is particularly true in cases when one person starts to believe that one can succeed without the other or when sentiments of inequity begin to brood. This an is inconvenient and often painful truth, that I have been forced to come to terms with in recent weeks.In any event, I assure you that the functionality of www.myetherwallet.com has not been interrupted or compromised in any way during the ownership transition. Fundamentally, the only change to MEW of consequence is that kvhnuke (Me! Kosala Hemachandra, IRL) has once again taken sole ownership of MEW, and will be directly overseeing the day-to-day operations of the site. In a sense, this is simply a return of the company to its roots \u2014 kvhnuke creating a user-focused platform that is safe and secure for the crypto community.To show the Ethereum community that we\u2019re serious about keeping MEW at the top its game, I will be contributing the ETH equivalent of $1 million USD from my personal funds to the MEW donation account. I hope that this donation communicates how passionately I believe in MyEtherWallet\u2019s future, and how dedicated to its mission I remain. More importantly, these funds will guarantee our team has the resources they require to make the advances needed to serve a growing and diverse community with transparency.Does MEW have a new team already in place to respond to any user issues or questions?Definitely! Although their names and faces are different, MEW has a dedicated team of customer care specialists and experienced developers working diligently to answer the Ethereum community\u2019s questions, and create a better experience for our users.Moreover, our new management team and I will be making changes to the company\u2019s organizational structure. I have learned from past mistakes, and have acknowledged where inefficiencies lie. With the explosion of interest in Ethereum and blockchain commerce over the last year or so, MEW has now become a full-time enterprise that requires a full-time team. Until the recent transition, MEW\u2019s team had been comprised almost entirely of independent contractors, most of whom only had part-time commitments. Contractors are independent businesses and as a result, MEW could not adequately oversee these workers, nor could MEW properly incentivize these workers to give their all. While hiring these types of workers was sufficient for the fledgling side project MEW was in 2016 and into the early part of 2017, it simply could not sustain for an ever-growing, ever-evolving enterprise.Post-transition, I\u2019m happy to say that I have already recruited eight passionate, experienced, and fun full-time team members who are motivated to give MEW and its users everything they\u2019ve got. And, we\u2019re are not done! MEW has been actively posting on the usual job sites seeking specific positions, but if you love MEW and believe you have something more to add to the team, then email your resume to jobs@myetherwallet.com. Feel free to tell us about yourself, and how you see yourself contributing to MEW\u2019s future.Are there new features and services forthcoming?You bet! It\u2019s no secret that the crypto community has grown at a staggering rate. There seem to be new MEW users everyday, but early adopters like yourselves want more \u2014 something safer, more feature-rich, and able to keep up with evolutionary changes in blockchain technology.Rest-assured that I, along with the rest of the MEW team, are prepared to meet these challenges head on. With these new donation funds, we will be adding the best people to our team to develop a better version of MyEtherWallet with a host of new features.Many in the community may be aware that prior to this transition, MEW was working to launch version 4 of the website. Due to the new landscape, as well as the fresh ideas being generated in the MyEtherWallet offices, we are in the process of reassessing this direction. Despite the amount of money and time MEW expended on V4, we\u2019ve also learned quite a bit along the way. While I believe that V4 introduces a quality product into the marketplace, we want to take time to consider new concepts as well as community feedback before moving forward with the current incarnation of V4. We will be making announcements about the next version of MEW in the coming weeks.Now naturally, you\u2019re final questions is likely, \u201cKosala, what will these new features be\u201d or \u201cWhat will the next version look like?\u201d I\u2019m not the kind of person who likes to announce the cool thing before I do it. I\u2019m the kind of person who does it first, and makes sure it\u2019s \u2018cool,\u2019 then announces it. But for now, I can say that we\u2019re working on a streamlined UX for newcomers, a diverse set of new features for the advanced user, and educational tools where new and established users can learn about MEW and the latest blockchain technologies.Also, our new ETH donation address is 0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D and Bitcoin address is 1DECAF2uSpFTP4L1fAHR8GCLrPqdwdLse9So stay tuned.

MEW V5, MyEtherWallet\u2019s All New Interface, Is HereMyEtherWalletFollowFeb 11 \u00b7 8 min readDear #MEWfam!We are excited and proud to present MEW V5, the new interface of our Ethereum blockchain portal, completely redesigned inside and out!There is a great deal of discussion in the crypto community about the necessity of providing a great user experience if we are to see widespread blockchain adoption. At MEW, we focus on getting the best ideas out of those discussions and then implementing them, as simply and intuitively as possible, for our users.Sure, there are pretty color schemes, cute buttons and friendly fonts \u2014 but at the end of the day, here\u2019s what a great user experience means to us:No nonsense. You shouldn\u2019t have to endure \u201ctech speak,\u201d but neither should you be spoken to like you are five. We believe in a simple interface, with customer support and education available on demand \u2014 welcoming to new users, and respectful to experienced ones.No intrusion. We don\u2019t store any data about users. There is no tracking, no emails, no ads and no demographics. We will never monetize in a way that interferes with user experience.Security matters most.In the world of crypto, interface updates are more than beautification \u2014 they are a process of arriving together, as a community, at what will work best for all current and future users of blockchains. Better interfaces are about discovering the most universally intuitive way of interacting with decentralized financial and governance structures, so that their promise of zero barrier to entry can be fully realized. We contribute to that goal by always striving to make our product more secure and more accessible!A Friendly FaceFrom the start, we wanted to create a platform that is compatible across different devices \u2014 desktop, tablet and mobile. The uncluttered, inviting interface works on any screen, immediately directing you to accessing your wallet or, if this is your first time using MEW, creating a new one.We intentionally approached our design with both the experienced user and the beginner in mind. For the experts, it should be easy to find everything they need quickly and easily. For the novices, we have made every effort to make the interface feel welcoming and to address any anxieties they may have.Intuitive and ConvenientFor example, it\u2019s easy to tell which methods of access are most secure. We recommend hardware wallets like Ledger, KeepKey, Secalot, Trezor and BitBox, or our own MEWconnect app. For your security, we do NOT recommend accessing with keystore file, private key or mnemonic phrase. MetaMask extension continues to be a good option for wallet access, and MEW works well with Web3-injected browsers like Brave.Once the wallet is accessed, you can take care of all tasks, from checking your balance to swapping coins to interacting with contracts, without ever having to re-login. Unlock once and use all features until you log out!Wallet balances are loaded automatically, without the need for third party extensions. Not only that, MEW V5 now features notifications! No need to wonder about the status of your transaction \u2014 you will find this information updated in the notifications section, found under the familiar little bell in the navigation bar.Tokens and Swaps, Just a Click AwayIntroducing our new partner \u2014 Changelly! Although, being one of the biggest token exchanges out there with hundreds of thousands of users, it hardly needs an introduction. We are very excited to bring the seamless swap functionality of this exchange to our users.Changelly will be operating alongside Bity and Kyber Network swap functions already available on MEW. We are now featuring the full range of Kyber Network\u2019s 60+ ERC20 tokens, including the new WBTC, for a fast, simple and secure way of exchanging tokens directly on our platform.Conveniently, the new swap page is more than a tool for swapping coins \u2014 it\u2019s also a crypto marketplace where you can shop for the best rates when purchasing cryptocurrencies. If you are entirely new to the space, Simplex offers an easy way to buy ETH with a credit card \u2014 so you can set out on your crypto journey without delay.The Ethereum ecosystem is always becoming more prolific and varied \u2014 there are so many tokens out there, so many opportunities to invest in something that is valuable to you. Managing all these tokens can be tricky, but we have implemented a long-requested feature to help you out \u2014 presenting the token search bar! Search and load 1100+ token balances in a matter of seconds, and if those are not enough, you can still add custom tokens, just as before.To take the FUD out of transactions, we have integrated SafeSend, an opt-in anti-fraud feature developed by Coral Protocol. SafeSend reroutes outgoing funds to a smart contract while Coral Protocol verifies the trustworthiness of the destination address. This awesome feature prevents users from accidentally sending money to a fraudster.Beyond Transactions: Blockchain ExplorationWith MEW, you are not limited to the Ethereum blockchain. On the wallet dashboard, you will find a way to switch to alternative nodes on ELO, CLO, Ropsten Testnet, and G\u00f6rli chains among many others, with future support for other networks. Don\u2019t forget that MEW provides custom node support as well!Blockchains are about so much more than funds storage and transactions! There has been a flurry of activity in the Ethereum ecosystem, with decentralized applications being created every day addressing a variety of interests \u2014 from collectibles to gaming and entertainment. Developing blockchain-based financial products, like CDPs and money markets, may become especially interesting to crypto investors.The new Dapps page on MEW V5 is built with the future of a decentralized ecosystem in mind. We intend to continue building partnerships and integrations that will allow our users to interact with and manage Dapps from right inside their MEW wallet.MEW ENS: Decentralization Made AccessibleOne great way that users can interact with the blockchain right now is through ENS domain ownership. Go ahead and type in your name, your brand or a fun acronym that could come in handy later! Pick a name for your wallet, so that others can transfer funds to you as easily as through personal messaging. With MEW, you can check the availability of ENS domains, start and finalize auctions, and manage domain ownership.Most excitingly, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) make decentralized hosting possible. Now, you can access MEW V5 not just on www.myetherwallet.com, but also using myetherwallet.eth (you need to have MetaMask extension installed). This means that MEW V5 is completely hosted in a decentralized cloud, supporting the following ENS networks: Ethereum, Ropsten, Goerli, RSK. We wouldn\u2019t be MEW if we didn\u2019t employ every technology available to make user experience more secure. ENS domains are built on smart contracts so they are not vulnerable like the DNS system. The real benefits of decentralization are becoming a reality and we are making sure that MEW users are first in line to take advantage!HD paths/Hardened PathsWe now fully support hardened HD paths. Recently, Ledger switched their default HD Paths to the hardened version, which is more secure, but a bit difficult to implement from front end. With MEW V5, you have complete support to hardened HD paths, allowing us to support latest Ledger and Keepkey default paths for HD wallets.Under the HoodWhen developing MEW V5, we did not just focus on the front end, because we would not be satisfied with a cosmetic change. We wanted to provide our users with a robust back end that can live up to the evolving future of the Ethereum ecosystem.Improved RPCWe made a complete overhaul of our API back end to enable all public RPC APIs and increased the efficiency of connections by a huge factor. Adding a new network is three clicks away and MEW V5 now supports all ETH APIs including \u2018web3\u2019, \u2018eth\u2019, \u2018pubsub\u2019, \u2018net\u2019, \u2018rpc\u201d, \u2018shh\u2019, \u2018shh_pubsub\u2019.Websockets supportAs many of you may know, RPC APIs are deprecated \u2014 meaning they will not be supported by Web3 in the future, but will be replaced by websockets. We wanted MEW V5 to be future-proof, so we enabled full websocket support for ETH, ROP and G\u00f6rli as part of the backend upgrade.Service workersService workers are one of the latest trends in web technology. These scripts enable users to have the latest version of a website without worrying about caching issues. An extremely efficient built-in caching mechanism means that even if you have intermittent internet connection, or temporarily go offline while in the middle of a transaction, the flow of actions will not be interrupted.PWA supportThis is another addition to service workers. With PWA, you have the option of installing the complete MEW website as an app on your phone and use it to access your wallet. Because we built our UI with mobile users in mind, it will simply behave like a native app.Vintage MEWWhile we believe that the new interface makes the experience of storing and managing crypto funds much simpler and more enjoyable, we realize that our crypto natives may have gotten used to the original website. Good news \u2014 Vintage MEW is staying around for a while! We are quite sentimental about the interface that helped our users access the Ethereum blockchain and manage their funds for over two years. Besides, as we perfect the new MEW V5, we want to make sure we didn\u2019t lose any of your favorite functionality from Vintage MEW.So there it is! We hope that you enjoy using MEW V5 as much as we loved creating it for you. Invite friends who are new to crypto to try it out, and let us know how it goes! As always, you can audit our open-source code on Github, reach out to us at support@myetherwallet.com, and comment on our social channels.Always here to help you on your crypto journey,#teamMEWMyEtherWallet.comTwitter InstagramRedditFacebookHackerOne", "responses": 10, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Crypto", "Blockchain", "UX", "Design"]}, {"title": "TREZOR Integration with MyEtherWallet", "post_link": "https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-integration-with-myetherwallet-3e217a652e08?source=search_post---------4", "author_name": "SatoshiLabs", "author_link": "https://blog.trezor.io/@satoshilabs", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-19", "readtime": "5.39", "claps": 1286, "voters": 206, "content": "TREZOR Integration with MyEtherWalletEthereum, Ethereum Classic and ERC-20 Interface for TREZORSatoshiLabsFollowFeb 3, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readIntroducing TREZOR integration with MyEtherWallet! Starting today, you can store ethers safely on your TREZORs. Control your private keys to all cryptocurrencies from the hardware wallet of your choice, and enjoy a perfect peace of mind!Ethereum is currently the cryptocurrency with the second highest market cap and second highest trade volume. We have long recognized the potential of ETH and implemented support for the coin with TREZOR firmware update 1.4.0. Facing limited resources, we are happy we can cooperate with MyEtherWallet to provide an easy and intuitive interface for you, when interacting with ethers. We believe that you, Ethereum users, will greatly benefit from this new integration!Ethereum and Ethereum Classic on TREZORYour ethers are stored and protected by the same recovery seed, which you have been using for bitcoins and other crypto. Therefore, there are no changes to how you should use your TREZOR. Your private keys to your coins remain stored in your TREZOR device even when using MEW.If you are familiar with how bitcoin works on TREZOR Wallet, the procedure is similar with Ethereum. You are just using a different wallet interface to your TREZOR.Recovering a seed on TREZOR will restore all of the cryptocurrencies, which were previously saved under the seed.TREZOR can also store ERC-20 Tokens!Just update to Firmware version 1.5.0 and above.TREZOR Firmware 1.5.0 \u2014 ERC-20, Litecoin SegWit, and RootstockTime flies by so quickly! Just look what happened to the price of bitcoin, ethers, litecoins, etc., in the meantime\u2026blog.trezor.ioGuide: Use TREZOR with MyEtherWallet!TREZOR has officially supported Ethereum since the firmware update to version 1.4.0. If you are using FW from 1.4.0 and above, you should be all set to use MyEtherWallet with TREZOR. For your convenience, we have prepared a short guide to introduce you to the main steps.If you haven\u2019t updated to FW 1.4.0 or higher yet and want to use these features, please follow this guide.Viewing Your Ethereum WalletThis guide assumes that your TREZOR has already been initialized and used on TREZOR Wallet, Electrum or Mycelium. If your TREZOR device is not configured yet (i.e. you haven\u2019t used it with any application yet), please visit TREZOR Wallet to initialize it first.First, let\u2019s open myetherwallet.com (MEW). Make sure you are using the correct currency. The selector is in the top-right part of MyEtherWallet.Since your TREZOR is already initialized, the Ethereum wallets have already been generated on the device. You are using MEW only to access them. Therefore, you can go to \u201cView Wallet Info\u201d or \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d immediately.Do not generate a new wallet on MyEtherWallet. Your TREZOR is your Ethereum wallet. If you have generated a new wallet on MyEtherWallet, then those coins that you have sent there are NOT saved with your TREZOR seed.Select \u201cTREZOR\u201d and then click on \u201cConnect to TREZOR\u201d.TREZOR Connect prompt will pop up, asking you to plug in your TREZOR device. Enter your PIN and Passphrase (if you have it enabled). Then, Connect will ask you to export your public key for Ethereum account #1. This is necessary, so that MEW can load your accounts and read their balances.This window will show your TREZOR accounts/addresses and their ETH/ETC balances. Unlock for more information.In the next window, you can see your ether addresses and their balance. You should use these addresses to receive ethers into your TREZOR. Each of the addresses is a separate account; always use one for a certain action, since you cannot spend coins from Account 1 when you are using Account 2.This is it \u2014 you are viewing your Ethereum accounts which are stored on your TREZOR. If you would like to view your token balances as well, select an account and click on \u201cUnlock\u201d.In newer MEW versions, you will also be asked to choose a derivation path. You should always opt for the default one that MEW chooses for you. If you are transferring from a different Ethereum wallet with a different derivation path, you may use this feature to transfer your coins to your TREZOR. Please contact our Support Team for assistance.The default derivation paths used by TREZOR for ETH/ETC are as follows:ETH: m/44'/60'/0'/0/iETC: m/44'/61'/0'/0/i(We recommend using the change index, even though ETH/ETC do not have change addresses)You will be brought to a page with Account details. From here, you can also continue with with the sending process, if you would like to.Sending TransactionsIf you had chosen \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d, you can continue from where we have left off in the previous section. If you had chosen \u201cView Wallet Info\u201d, please select \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d, unlock TREZOR and select an account.At this stage, you are ready to send transactions. Enter the details, such as the amount to send and the gas limit (transaction fee) and click on \u201cGenerate Transaction\u201d.Another TREZOR Connect prompt will show up and ask you to confirm the transaction on your TREZOR. (Your TREZOR has been unlocked in the previous stage.) Verify the transaction details before confirming.After confirming on the device, the transaction won\u2019t be sent yet. The signed transaction data from TREZOR will be transmitted back to MEW, for one more confirmation.

Kvhnuke has just responded with a statement on Reddit.Neither of them is very forthcoming about the details of the split and why it happened but it is worth noting that:Tayvano emphasizes how hard she worked on MEW in 2017, to the point of exhaustion, but pointedly says nothing about any work put in by kvhnuke. She only includes graphs of their respective code contributions over the years which appear to show that she has contributed significantly more code to MEW in the last couple of years. The implication is clear.Kvhnuke confirms that the vast majority of the MEW team has left with Tayvano, but says that he cannot go into the reasons for the split and reassures everyone that MEW is functional and he is control of the code and product and it\u2019s business as usual.I thought I\u2019d dig into this a little more, because every day at work I see that bad blood between co-founders often ends up in court, and lo and behold, here we have Kosala Hemachandra v Taylor Monahan & MyEtherWallet LLC, Case No. BS171730 in the Los Angeles County Superior Court (I downloaded the primary Petition in the case and put it on Dropbox for easy access here).This could be interesting.DISCLAIMER: I am qualified to practice law in England & Wales and India. I am not a California lawyer, and this is not legal advice, merely informed speculation by an experienced commercial litigator. I do not know kvhnuke or tayvano personally and have no connection with them or MEW. Also, this is being written on the day the news broke, based on the court documents I\u2019ve seen and news from various online sources. Further developments could render this analysis invalid or out of date, as more information comes to light.The Petition tells us a lot, but raises almost as many questions as it answers.In essence, the case involves kvhnuke saying that all documents and financial records of the MyEtherWallet LLC company are in tayvano\u2019s possession and that he is entitled to inspect them as a co-owner of the company, but she (according to him) is refusing to give him copies.There is a hearing scheduled in the case for 27 March 2018, but since they have now split and the MEW company has been dissolved (see below), the case will probably go nowhere on this issue (unless kvhnuke never got the documents and wants them badly for some reason \u2014 for example, he may need them to pursue more litigation). However, all kinds of other issues relating to the split could get added to the case.It looks like kvhnuke and tayvano haven\u2019t been getting along for some time. The documents don\u2019t shed light on the reasons for the breakdown in the relationship, but it isn\u2019t hard to guess, based on tayvano\u2019s post \u2014 she clearly feels he hasn\u2019t been pulling his weight. We haven\u2019t heard kvhnuke\u2019s side of the story (except the part about her refusing to hand over documents he was entitled to see), but the fact that tayvano managed to convince most of the employees to go with her (and the evidence of the code contributions) suggests there is some weight to her story.In any event, according to the documents, they appear to have been in negotiations as of October 2017, for tayvano to sell her share in MEW to kvhnuke for $1 million, which would leave him in sole control. In the course of the negotiations, kvhnuke felt (justifiably, IMHO) that it is difficult for him to commit to a purchase price without seeing all the accounting records and documents for the company, because he can\u2019t conduct his due diligence on the company without them. Tayvano\u2019s refusal (or more precisely, what appears to be inadequate production of documents) resulted in this case being filed.Some more poking through company incorporation records in California shows that MyCrypto LLC was incorporated as far back as August 2017, which means tayvano has been planning this split for at least that long and probably a good deal longer.It also shows that the MyEtherWallet LLC company has been dissolved \u2014 unilaterally by tayvano alone \u2014 as of 29 Dec 2017. Which begs the question \u2014 what company is kvhnuke running now? Who actually owns and operates MEW? It could certainly have been transferred to another company \u2014 but has it been? The website security certificate still says \u201cMyEtherWallet LLC\u201d.We don\u2019t know for sure of course, but I suspect that what happened is that negotiations for a buyout by kvhnuke and an amicable separation broke down. In connection with this, MyEtherWallet LLC has now been dissolved by tayvano (why?), and it looks like she has taken most of the employees and left to start a new company. Kvhnuke is left with control of the MEW software/codebase/brand and maybe a few employees (there appears to be a fight for control of the @myetherwallet Twitter account though), but since MyEtherWallet LLC has been dissolved, the legal status of all of these things is unclear.However, as far as MEW\u2019s functionality goes, no one\u2019s crypto holdings should be affected. MEW (and now MyCrypto) is only a front-end for accessing the Ethereum blockchain and the blockchain itself is not affected by this (it\u2019s like using different apps to access your Gmail account \u2014 your email stays in the same place, whatever app you use to access it). Also, the MEW codebase is public and any suspicious changes to the code etc will be easily spotted, so I am not worried about that aspect \u2014 only whether such a useful tool (now two) will survive and continue to get better.I spy more litigation and stormy seas ahead (tayvano\u2019s comment in her article that \u201cMyEtherWallet will continue to be online until it, for whatever reason, is not online\u201d may be a reference to current and potential litigation). I only hope the valuable service that MEW (and now MyCrypto) provides continues for the benefit of the wider crypto community.UPDATE: It\u2019s been pointed out on Reddit that it is inaccurate for me to say that tayvano dissolved MyEtherWallet LLC \u201cunilaterally\u2026alone\u201d, because when you look at the relevant documents, the company appears to have had three members/shareholders, and two of them (tayvano and the third member) dissolved the company. This is factually correct, so I am updating this post to reflect that. I could have chosen my words better \u2014 I meant to say that tayvano appears to have dissolved the company without kvhnuke\u2019s co-operation, and as far as we know, that appears to be true. I did not mean to imply that there were only two shareholders in the company or that tayvano was the only signatory to the dissolution.", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Myetherwallet", "Crypto", "Ethereum", "Ethereum Wallet"]}, {"title": "Participating in Token Sale: Creating MyEtherWallet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/consentium/participating-in-token-sale-creating-myetherwallet-8e6f6aa535fa?source=search_post---------8", "author_name": "Consentium", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@consentium", "publish_date": "2018-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-08", "readtime": "2.92", "claps": 586, "voters": 82, "content": "Participating in Token Sale: Creating MyEtherWalletConsentiumFollowApr 13, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWith the token sale launching in 2 days, be sure that you have already prepared yourself for the token sale!To receive CSM coins, you will first need a digital wallet to store your CSM coins.
